This list of applets is expected to grow as InkHUD continues to evolve.

## All Messages

Displays the most recent message. Both in-channel messages and DMs will be shown.

    alt="inkhud all messages applet"
    style={{margin: '0px'}}
  />
</div>

1. Time received
2. Sender's short name
3. Sender's long name

## DMs

Displays the most recent direct message (DM) only.

![inkhud direct message applet](/img/software/inkhud/applet-dm.webp)

1. Time received
2. Sender's short name
3. Sender's long name

## Channel 0

Displays several recent messages from channel 0. Older messages should be viewed in a connected [client app](/downloads/).  

![inkhud channel0 applet](/img/software/inkhud/applet-channel0.webp)

1. Channel name
2. Sender's short name
3. Time received
4. Outgoing message

## Canal 1

Displays several recent messages from channel 1 (secondary channel). Older messages should be viewed in a connected [client app](/downloads/).  

![inkhud channel1 applet](/img/software/inkhud/applet-channel1.webp)

1. Channel name
2. Sender's short name
3. Time received
4. Outgoing message

## Positions

Displays the reported position of all nodes, as a crude map.

North is always aligned with the top of the screen. The size of each cross indicates how many [hops away](/docs/overview#how-it-works) a node is. Nodes marked `!` are beyond your [max hops setting](/docs/configuration/radio/lora#max-hops), making them _unreachable_. 

![inkhud positions applet](/img/software/inkhud/applet-positions.webp)

1. Your own node
2. Node which most recently sent position
3. Others nodes

_Improvements are planned for this applet._

## Recents List

Displays a list, and count, of nodes which were heard within the past few minutes.

When a node is heard, it is placed at the top of the list. Stale entries are automatically removed. If the list grows long, the oldest entries will scroll off-screen. To change how many minutes of information this applet shows, adjust [Recents Duration](index.mdx#recents-duration) in the on-screen menu.

![inkhud recents list applet](/img/software/inkhud/applet-recentslist.webp)

1. Amount of nodes recently heard
2. Short name
3. Long name
4. Signal (if heard directly)
5. Brinca afuera
6. Distance from our node (if known)

## Heard

Displays a list of other nodes and their information, sorted by most recently heard. _Information about older nodes is available in your [client app](/downloads/)._

A total count of known nodes is also displayed, unless your node database is full (at least 80 nodes). 

![inkhud heard applet](/img/software/inkhud/applet-heard.webp)

1. Total amount of known nodes
2. Short name
3. Long name
4. Signal (if we hear node directly, 0 hops)
5. Brinca afuera
6. Distance from our node (if known)
