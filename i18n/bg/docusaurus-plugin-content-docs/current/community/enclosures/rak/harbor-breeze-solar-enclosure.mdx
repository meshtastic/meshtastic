### Low Cost Harbor Breeze Solar Light RAK Enclosure Hack

![Solar Hack Complete](/img/enclosures/hbmh_complete.webp)

The Harbor Breeze Solar LED light can be purchased for about $15 and includes a capable solar panel, lithium ion cell and charge controller in a waterproof enclosure. The RAK baseboards fit perfectly inside the solar compartment. Below are the steps for completing this hack for a completely weatherproof solar powered Meshtastic node.

### Необходими умения

Необходимо е малко запояване, както и пробиване на отвор в пластмасовия корпус.

### Необходими неща

Необходим е ipex към sma пигтейл, за да има външна антена. Необходим е JST-PHR-2 конектор, ако искате свързване на батерията с конектор. Запоената връзка също ще работи. Уплътняващо лепило (силикон или морски уплътнител)

### Стъпки

Стъпка 1. Unscrew 4 small screws to open the solar compartment.

Стъпка 2. Solder your battery JST-PHR-2 connector or power wires to the + and - terminals of the battery. If you don't have the proper connector you can solder directly to the pins on the back of the JST connector, just make sure you get the polarity correct.

Стъпка 3. Drill the hole for your sma pigtail. A perfectly vertical antenna via 90 degree bend will not allow for a very flat solar panel so choose wisely or use an externally mounted antenna. You can skip this step if you want to use an internal antenna that fits.

Стъпка 4. Install the sma pigtail. Seal with silicone or marine sealant.

Стъпка 5. Install the RAK module in the free space. You can lightly tack glue this in place if you want to.

Стъпка 6. Connect the antenna and battery and close up the back.

The light housing can be removed if not needed.

The light housing is not as waterproof as the solar enclosure so be careful if putting electronics inside of it.
Attach to a stick and put it high up.

The light will still turn on at night for a very stealthy node. To turn off the light there is a button on the back.
