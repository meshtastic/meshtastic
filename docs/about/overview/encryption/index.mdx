## Explanation

Meshtastic encrypts packet payloads using either a symmetric key or public key depending on the content and destination. [Channel](/docs/configuration/radio/channels/) broadcasts use AES in counter (CTR) mode, with a 128-bit key for the shared default channel and 256-bit keys for private channels. Direct messages use public key cryptography. The [packet header](/docs/overview/mesh-algo/#layer-1-unreliable-zero-hop-messaging) is always sent unencrypted, which allows nodes to relay packets they cannot decrypt. This behavior can be disabled by selecting a different [rebroadcast mode](/docs/configuration/radio/device#rebroadcast-mode).

By default, you have one primary channel, which is encrypted with a [known default key](#shared-default-key). The primary channel is used for all periodic broadcasts generated by the device (position, telemetry, traceroutes, etc.). To have private communication, you must create a channel with a private key and share it only with the devices you intend to communicate with.

Direct messages to a specific node are now encrypted using Public Key Cryptography (PKC). Each node is equipped with a unique public/private key pair, and direct messages are encrypted with the recipient's public key. This ensures that only the recipient can decrypt the message using their private key. Additionally, messages are signed with the sender's private key, allowing the recipient to verify the sender's identity and ensuring the message's integrity.

The device will decrypt the payload before sending it to a client app via BLE, serial, Wi-Fi/Ethernet. For MQTT, you can [specify](/docs/configuration/module/mqtt#encryption-enabled) whether you want to send an encrypted or unencrypted payload.

### Shared Default Key

The default Meshtastic primary channel uses a fixed, well-known AES128 key that is distributed to all Meshtastic devices. This channel exists to allow zero-configuration interoperability between new or unconfigured nodes. This shared key also allows devices to receive and broadcast node info, position, device telemetry, and information from [other modules](/docs/configuration/module/). This public information enriches your client software's understanding of the local mesh and sharing it contributes to the quality of the mesh for other users. If you choose not to use the default channel, your device will participate in the mesh as a relay node, but you will not be able to access public broadcasts or benefit from applications that require intermediate decryption.

The shared key is shown in client applications as `"AQ=="`. This is an alias of the real 16 byte key and is **not** the actual AES key. Using this alias instructs the firmware to use the built-in public channel key. The actual AES128 key used for the public channel is `"1PG7OiApB1nwvP+rz05pAQ=="` (base64 encoded). This key is constant, non-secret, and published in the firmware source and elsewhere. As a result, anyone following local traffic or monitoring via [MQTT](docs/configuration/module/mqtt/) can decrypt messages on this channel.

## Is it as secure as Wi-Fi WPA3, HTTPS TLS1.3, or Signal?

**No**.

[WPA3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPA3), [TLS1.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS1.3), [Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol), and Meshtastic can all use AES256. Yet AES is one of the many cogs required in a modern encryption system. Below are the main features "missing" in Meshtastic.

### Perfect-Forward-Secrecy

[**P**erfect-**F**orward-**S**ecrecy, also known as **PFS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy), means _previous_ communications and more generally anything _passively captured_ cannot be decrypted **_even when the key is compromised_**.

This means Meshtastic is vulnerable to [**« Harvest now, Decrypt later »**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later) attacks. **This attack itself is not enough to decrypt messages**; it relies on another failure leaking the channel key, such as:

- Accidentally sharing the channel key with the wrong person.
- One of your nodes being stolen.
- Any unknown bug revealing the channel key to an attacker.

Other protocols, such as _misconfigured TLS1.2_, are far more impacted by Harvest now, Decrypt later attacks because their keys will be broken by near-future Quantum-Computers, yet they do not provide PFS either.

Meshtastic's AES256 encryption is considered quantum-resistant[^1], but the public/private key exchange for DMs is not, as current quantum-resistant cryptography schemes don't fit in LoRa packets or our IoT hardware; realistic attack vectors include accidental mishandling of channel keys, nodes being lost, and potential future quantum attacks on DM key exchanges.

[^1]: On the Quantum-Resistance of AES256, see [this stackoverflow question, containing a bit of debate and two good answers](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/q/6712) and the [NIST's Post-Quantum FAQ](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/faqs) section "To protect against the threat of quantum computers, should we double the key length for AES now? (added 11/18/18)"

#### Recommendations for users using private channels

- **Do not configure private channels on unattended nodes**. Nodes will relay Meshtastic traffic even if they are not able to decrypt it. Your unattended routers should not have the private PSK configured as it is easy to gain physical access and extract the channel key.
- Keep in mind that everything sent on a channel can be stored and decrypted later by anyone who gains access to the key, even if you locally delete the messages.
- Change your Channel Keys from time to time.

#### Changes since 2.5.0 Firmware release

- Direct Messages are now protected with PKC when messaging between devices on v2.5.0 or newer and key exchange has taken place, messaging to legacy 2.4.3 or older firmware versions are not protected.
- Admin Messages between two v2.5.0 or newer nodes are now protected and additional relay attack protection is in place.

### Integrity

Integrity means ensuring messages cannot be modified without the key.

Meshtastic does not verify the integrity of channel messages to check if they have been tampered with (see [issue #4030](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/issues/4030) for details).

#### Recommendations

- Keep in mind that by applying a known plaintext attack, anyone _could_ send messages on a channel even if the channel key is private and secure.
- For developers of third-party applications integrating Meshtastic, include a cryptographic MAC over the message content and PSK. We are also considering an [AEAD secured channel mode which would provide this natively](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/issues/4030).

#### Changes since 2.5.0 Firmware release

- Message integrity is checked for Direct Messages or Admin Control when communication is between v2.5.0 or newer firmware.

### Authentication

Authentication means nodes say who they are on the network. Meshtastic does not implement this, so it is trivial to impersonate anyone else if you have access to the channel key

This is because node IDs are based on hardware [MAC address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address), which are hardcoded by the manufacturer.

Some other networks like [Yggdrasil](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/), [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns), or [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) use [public/private key pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), and the Public Key becomes the Node Identity. This makes all messages bigger and/or requires an interactive handshake process.

#### Recommendations

- Keep in mind that the sender field is indicative, and anyone with access to the channel key can trivially lie.

#### Changes since 2.5.0 Firmware release

- The above now only relates to group chats/channels as DM's are protected when messaging between devices on 2.5 or newer, messaging to legacy 2.4 or older devices are not afforded this addition authentication.

## Direct Messages

Direct Messages (DMs) are now implemented using Public Key Cryptography (PKC). This provides a significant upgrade in security compared to the previous channel-based encryption:

- **Message Encryption:** Each DM is encrypted using the recipient's public key, ensuring that only the recipient can decrypt the message with their private key.
- **Digital Signatures:** Messages are signed with the sender's private key, allowing the recipient to verify the sender's identity and ensuring the integrity of the message.

### Prior to 2.5.0 Firmware Release

Previously, DMs were implemented as channel messages with a `to` protobuf field set. This meant anyone in the channel could read all your direct messages. With PKC, this issue is resolved, as only the intended recipient can decrypt and read the message.

### Recommendations

- While PKC significantly enhances the security of DMs, it's still advisable to avoid sharing sensitive information in direct messages without proper verification of the recipient's public key.

## Admin Messages

Admin Messages/Control are now protected by enhanced security features, making sure that critical operations within the network are more secure than ever before.

- **Stronger Encryption:** Admin Messages now use advanced encryption methods to ensure that only the intended recipients can access and read them.
- **Session IDs:** Each administrative session is assigned a unique Session ID, which helps prevent unauthorized access and ensures that messages are not tampered with or replayed.

### Prior to 2.5.0 Firmware Release

Previously, admin messages were not as secure, but with these updates, they are now much better protected against potential attacks and replay attacks.

### Recommendations

- Always ensure that your devices are using the latest firmware to benefit from these improved security features.
- Regularly monitor your network for any unusual activity to maintain a high level of security.
