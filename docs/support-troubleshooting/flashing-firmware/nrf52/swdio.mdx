description: Instructions for uploading firmware through SWDIO by using a Raspberry Pi.

Most Meshtastic devices can be flashed simply using USB.
However, some (eg Seeed WM1110 Dev Kit) require the use of an external device that can connect via "SWDIO".
There are dedicated devices such as the [RAKDAP1](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/daplink-tool)
that can do this work. However, for many people a Raspberry Pi is more convenient.

This article provides instructions on how use a Raspberry Pi as a SWDIO Flash Tool.

## Set up Wiring
The first step is to connect two wires between your Raspberry Pi and the SWDIO ports on your NRF52-based device.

Connect GPIO pin 11 on your Raspbery Pi to the CLK pin on the Meshtastic Device.
Connect GPIO pin 8 on your Raspbery Pi to the DIO pin on the Meshtastic Device.

Ensure you get the GPIO numbers correct.

Plug in your Raspberry Pi to USB power.
Plug in the Meshtastic Device to power.

## Install OpenOCD

You can use OpenOCD to manage the SWDIO connection with the Meshtastic Device.
Install it on your Raspberry Pi.

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install libtool autoconf automake texinfo telnet gdb-multiarch git
$ git clone git://repo.or.cz/openocd.git
$ cd openocd/
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --enable-bcm2835gpio
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
```

## Check connection
Let's try connecting to the NRF52-based device with SWDIO before we do anything with firmware.
All the configuration you need is in the openocd repository.

```
$ openocd -f ./openocd/tcl/interface/raspberrypi-native.cfg -c "transport select swd" -f openocd/tcl/target/nrf52.cfg -s tcl
```

The first flag selects the Raspberry Pi as your host machine, the transport is SWDIO, and the last flag says you are connecting to a nRF52-based chip.
You should see something like this:

```

```

 
If you see “Error connecting DP: cannot read IDR”, then you've probably connected the wires to the wrong place.
 
## Obtaining Firmware
Check the instructions for your [hardware](/docs/hardware/devices) to find the correct firmware for your device.
For most devices following this guide, a .hex file is required.
Then, copy the firmware file to your Raspberry Pi.
 

## Flashing Firmware
Once you have openocd running, you can connect to your Meshtastic device using telnet.
Flashing is as simple as running a few commands inside the telnet session:

```
$ telnet 127.0.0.1 4444
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to 127.0.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
Open On-Chip Debugger
> init
> reset init
> halt
> nrf5 mass_erase
> program firmware.hex verify
> reset
> exit 0
```

Unplug the power and plug it back in after flashing.

## Connecting
Congratulations, you should now be able to connect to your device through Bluetooth in the Meshtastic app.
