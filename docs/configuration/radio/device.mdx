[^1]: **Awake Only** indicates retransmissions will occur normally but not while asleep between transmission intervals.

[^2]: The `ROUTER` role enables [Power Saving](/docs/configuration/radio/power/#power-saving) by default (ESP32 only). When needing to update a `ROUTER` via BLE, it's recommended you utilize an admin channel to temporarily change the role in order to update and then revert when done.

## Notes about Power Saving + Role behavior

### ESP32 Platform Only

Every role except for the `TRACKER` and `SENSOR` roles are capable of traditional _sleep_ behavior using the `power.is_power_saving` setting. When a node goes to sleep, in general, the serial console, peripherals, GPS, and WiFi/Bluetooth radio are all shut down to conserve power. The CPU will enter a low power state (light sleep or deep sleep on the ESP32). The LoRA radio will be left on stand-by for receiving any packets which will _wake up_ the device to resume services and respond.

Timeout configurations of `display.screen_on_secs` (Screen timeout), `power.min_wake_secs` (Minimum time till sleep), and `power.wait_bluetooth_secs` (Bluetooth timeout) will delay a node's transition to a sleep state. The timeouts and subsequent transition to sleep states may also be _reset_ by external events or actions such as receiving a packet, pressing a button, or connecting via client through serial or other means.

For the `ROUTER` role, the `power.is_power_saving` behavior of sleep is enabled automatically and cannot be turned off.

### ESP32 and NRF52 Platforms

In the `TRACKER` and `SENSOR` roles, there are special sleep behaviors when combined with `power.is_power_saving`. For `TRACKER`, the device will go to sleep for `position.position_broadcast_secs` and upon waking will send a position packet when the GPS provides a valid location and repeat the cycle. For `SENSOR`, the device will go to sleep for `telemetry.environment_update_interval` and upon waking will gather environment data and send a telemetry packet and repeat the cycle. For both of these roles, the LoRA radio does not remain in standby mode to accept packets and wake up the device. Sleep remains constrained to their respective transmission intervals.

## Rebroadcast Mode

This setting defines the device's behavior for how messages are rebroadcasted.

|        Value         |                                                                                                  Description                                                                                                  |
| :------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|        `ALL`         |               ALL (Default) - This setting will rebroadcast ALL messages from its primary mesh as well as other meshes with the same modem settings, including when encryption settings differ.               |
| `ALL_SKIP_DECODING`  |                                  ALL_SKIP_DECODING - Same as behavior as ALL, but skips packet decoding and simply rebroadcasts them. **Only available with Repeater role.**                                  |
|     `LOCAL_ONLY`     |             LOCAL_ONLY - Ignores observed messages from foreign meshes that are open or those which it cannot decrypt. Only rebroadcasts message on the nodes local primary / secondary channels.             |
|     `KNOWN_ONLY`     |            KNOWN_ONLY - Ignores observed messages from foreign meshes like LOCAL_ONLY, but takes it a step further by also ignoring messages from nodenums not in the node's known list (NodeDB).             |
|        `NONE`        |                                       NONE - Only permitted for SENSOR, TRACKER and TAK_TRACKER roles, this will inhibit all rebroadcasts, not unlike CLIENT_MUTE role.                                       |
| `CORE_PORTNUMS_ONLY` | CORE_PORTNUMS_ONLY - Ignores packets from non-standard portnums such as: TAK, RangeTest, PaxCounter, etc. Only rebroadcasts packets with standard portnums: NodeInfo, Text, Position, Telemetry, and Routing. |

## TZDEF (Timezone Definition)

The `tzdef` setting allows the local offset to be defined for the device. It uses the TZ Database format to display the correct local time on the device display and in its logs.

To set the timezone, use the POSIX TZ Database string for the relevant region. Here is a list of [supported timezones](https://github.com/nayarsystems/posix_tz_db/blob/master/zones.csv). For example, if your region is `America/Los_Angeles`, you would input `PST8PDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0` as the timezone.

## GPIO for user button

This is the GPIO pin number that will be used for the user button, if your device does not come with a predefined user button.

## GPIO for PWM Buzzer

This is the GPIO pin number that will be used for the PWM buzzer, if your device does not come with a predefined buzzer.

## Node Info Broadcast Seconds

This is the number of seconds between NodeInfo message (containing i.a. long and short name) broadcasts from the device. The device will still respond ad-hoc to NodeInfo messages when a response is wanted. When the device hears any packet from a node it doesn't know yet, it will send its NodeInfo and ask for a response automatically.

## Double Tap as Button Press

This option will enable a double tap, when a supported accelerometer is attached to the device, to be treated as a button press.

Because the device will reboot after each command is sent via CLI, it is recommended when setting multiple values in a config section that commands be chained together as one.
