import { Icon } from "@iconify/react";
import { CompatibilityIcons } from '@site/src/components/CompatibilityIcons';

The user config options are: Long Name, Short Name, Is Licensed, and Is Unmessageable. User config uses an admin message sending a `User` protobuf.

## User Config Values

### Long Name <CompatibilityIcons configKey="user_long_name" />

A personalized name for your device.

Auto-generated by default.

If you are a licensed ham operator and have enabled `IsLicensed`, this should be set to your ham operator call sign.

### Short Name <CompatibilityIcons configKey="user_short_name" />

A personalized short identifier for your device.

Auto-generated by default.

### Is Licensed (ham) <CompatibilityIcons configKey="user_is_licensed" />

If you are a licensed ham operator and have considered the [privileges and restrictions](/docs/faq/#amateur-radio-ham) of using Meshtastic with a ham license, enable this flag.

Disabled by default.

By enabling `IsLicensed`, you should also review the following related configurations:

- **User:** `LongName` (Should be your Call Sign)
- **Channel:** `PSK` (Should be Empty, removing encryption)

### Is Unmessageable <CompatibilityIcons configKey="user_is_unmessageable" />

Whether or not the node can be direct messaged

Default is False except for roles that typically would not be monitored for direct messages: ROUTER, ROUTER_LATE, REPEATER, SENSOR, LOST_AND_FOUND, TRACKER, TAK_TRACKER 

## CLI Examples

Please see instructions for [Enabling Ham License](/docs/software/python/cli/usage#ham-radio-support)

:::tip

Because the device will reboot after each command is sent via CLI, it is recommended when setting multiple values in a config section that commands be chained together as one.

```shell title="Example:"
meshtastic --set-owner 'your node name' --set-owner-short  'NODE'
```

:::

```shell title="Set the LongName Value"
meshtastic --set-owner 'your node name'
```

```shell title="Set the ShortName Value"
meshtastic --set-owner-short  'NODE'
```

```shell title="Enable Ham Mode, set name to license, disable encryption"
meshtastic  --set-ham 'CALLSIGN'
```
