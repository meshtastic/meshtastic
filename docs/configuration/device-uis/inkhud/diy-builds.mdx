## DIY Presets

Tried-and-tested hardware combinations, with pre-made configurations.

### Supported Hardware

#### Base Device

- Heltec Mesh Node T114
- NRF52 Pro-micro DIY

#### Display Module

- WeAct Studio 1.54" B&W
- WeAct Studio 2.13" B&W (2025 Revision)
- WeAct Studio 2.9" B&W
- WeAct Studio 4.2" B&W

### Firmware

Although configurations for these devices are provided, you will still need to build the Meshtastic firmware.

#### Building With Visual Studio Code

First, [set up the build environment](/docs/development/firmware/build/#build), then:

1. Open the PlatformIO Project Tasks pane

2. Select the environment which matches your node hardware
   - `heltec-mesh-node-t114-inkhud`
   - `nrf52_promicro_diy-inkhud`

3. Run the Build task which matches your display model
   ![custom platformio build tasks for diy presets](/img/software/inkhud/diy-presets.webp)

4. Once build is complete, find the generated .uf2 file at `./pio/build/<environment>/firmware.uf2`
   ![uf2 output file from firmware build](/img/software/inkhud/firmware-build-output.webp)

#### Building with Platformio CLI

Execute `pio run -e <environment> -t <build task>`, where:

`<environment>`

- `heltec-mesh-node-t114-inkhud`
- `nrf52_promicro_diy-inkhud`

`<build task>`

- `build_weact_154`
- `build_weact_213`
- `build_weact_290`
- `build_weact_420`

Then find the generated .uf2 file at `./pio/build/<environment>/firmware.uf2`

### Installation

Install the generated .uf2 file to device using the [drag and drop method](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/drag-n-drop/#nrf52).

## Other Hardware

Using InkHUD on hardware beyond the standard DIY presets will require manual customization of the firmware.
No specific support can be given here; only a general overview.

**Check for a Display Driver**

InkHUD relies on custom display drivers.
These are located in `/src/graphics/niche/Drivers/EInk/`.
Choose a display which is already supported; otherwise, you will have to write the driver yourself, which requires some specialist knowledge.

**Clone and Modify an Existing InkHUD Variant**

The general instructions for [building with custom hardware](/docs/development/firmware/build/#build-with-custom-hardware) apply here.
In addition to modifying the `variant.h` file, you should also [modify `nicheGraphics.h`](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/tree/master/src/graphics/niche/InkHUD/docs#nichegraphicsh),
which is responsible for InkHUD's per-variant configuration.
