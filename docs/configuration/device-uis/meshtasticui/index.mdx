## What is Meshtastic UI?

Meshtastic UI (MUI) is an independent user interface for Meshtastic devices, designed to provide direct interaction with the network without requiring a phone app for most basic settings. Initially developed for standalone touchscreen devices, MUI has since expanded to support Linux-native systems, making it a versatile solution across different hardware platforms. While many settings can be configured directly, some advanced options may still require pairing with another device, such as a phone.

Development of MUI began around early 2024, and after more than a year of active work, the initial preview was released in early 2025. By that time, it had grown to 12,000 lines of handwritten code, 50,000 lines of generated code, successfully ported to 10 different devices, and translated into 18 languages. MUI will continue to evolve with new features, optimizations, and expanded hardware support.

### Supported Devices

MUI is compatible with a variety of devices, including:

- **Standalone LoRa devices with ESP32-S3 and a TFT display**
  - LilyGo T-Deck
  - Seeed SenseCAP Indicator
  - unPhone
  - PICOmputer
- **CYD-style devices with ESP32-S3 connected via serial to any LoRa device**
  - T-HMI
  - Mesh-Tab "Replicator" (ESP-4848S040)
  - Makerfabs 4"
- **Embedded Linux devices with SPI/I2C and GPIOs**
  - Raspberry Pi
  - Milk-V
  - LuckFox with TFT SPI and LoRa hat
- **Linux native setups**
  - PC with Meshstick or SIMRadio simulation using X11 MUI

### Installation

For most standalone devices, MUI can be installed using the [Meshtastic Web Flasher](https://flasher.meshtastic.org). Look for the MUI logo on supported hardware, select a 2.6+ version firmware, and toggle the Meshtastic UI option on the flash screen.

Some devices are not supported in the web flasher but have prebuilt firmware binaries available. These firmware files can be identified by the **"-tft"** suffix in the filename. Prebuilt firmware can be found on the [downloads page](/downloads/).

Certain supported devices do not have automatic firmware builds or web flasher support. These devices require manual compilation and flashing. Instructions for building firmware manually can be found in the [development documentation](/docs/development/firmware/build/).

## Usage

### SD Card Support

For devices with supported SD card slots, ensure the card is properly configured before use. The SD card should be formatted using MBR. MUI supports both FAT32 and exFAT partitions, with exFAT being the recommended format.

### Initial Setup

Upon first booting MUI on a device or after factory resetting a device, the initial screen displayed is a quick configuration screen to set the device's region and both long name and short name. This screen allows these settings to be set at the same time, requiring only one reboot, rather than separately setting each one and rebooting twice.

    alt="Meshtastic UI Initial Setup"
  />
</div>

### Home Dashboard

The Home Dashboard is the first screen displayed each time the device boots after completing the Initial Setup Screen. It provides a quick overview of the device’s status and allows for fast navigation to select areas or making settings changes. Many elements support both long and short press actions for additional functionality.

For a detailed breakdown of available controls and their functions, refer to the Dashboard Infographic.

#### Chat Messages

Inside a chat, messages are threaded:

- Messages from other devices appear on the left.
- Messages from the local device appear on the right.
- When a message is sent, the outline of the message box will update based on its status:
  - If an acknowledgment (ACK) is received, the message outline will change to Meshtastic green.
  - If max retransmissions are reached and no ACK is received, the message outline will turn red.
  - If the message is heard and forwarded by other nodes, and no ack from the intended recipient yet, the message outline will turn yellow.

### Map

The map screen displays map tiles stored on the SD card of the device. No map tiles are included, and must be manually added to the SD card in either a `/map` if using a single style or `/maps/{STYLE}/` directory if using multiple styles. Tiles must be 256x256 PNG images and a 256-color palette with 8-bit color depth is recommended.

A starter set of tiles for zoom levels 1-6 covering the Earth is available, along with instructions for obtaining additional map tiles, at [this link](https://github.com/meshtastic/device-ui/tree/master/maps).

#### Map Controls

The map screen displays the selected map style and provides interactive controls for navigation:

- **Arrow Icons** – Move/pan the map view in any direction.
- **Magnifying Glass (+/-)** – Adjust the zoom level.
- **GPS Icon** – Centers the map on the device’s current GPS position (if available).
- **Crosshairs** – Recenter on home position, long press to manually set a new home position.

If no devices with a known location are present and the device itself does not have a location, the map will default to Big Ben in London, UK.

## Bluetooth Programming Mode

MUI functions as a client, similar to the Android and Apple apps. It runs on one core of the MCU, while the regular Meshtastic firmware runs on the other. MUI communicates with the firmware using the Client API, the same interface used by other Meshtastic clients.

The Client API supports only one active connection at a time, which means Bluetooth cannot be used while MUI is running. Since not all settings can be configured within MUI, Bluetooth Programming Mode allows users to temporarily disable MUI, enabling Bluetooth so the device can be configured via another client app.

### Accessing Bluetooth Programming Mode

Bluetooth Programming Mode can be enabled in two ways:

- During boot – Press and hold the Meshtastic logo on the boot screen.
- Press the bluetooth icon in the shutdown/reset menu within settings.

<div align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/software/meshtastic-ui/shutdown_screen.webp"
    alt="Reset/Bluetooth Programming Mode/Shutdown"
    width="60%"
  />
</div>

When activated, the device reboots into Bluetooth Programming Mode. While in this mode, the screen will display a randomly generated PIN, which must be entered when connecting via Bluetooth on the client app.

<div align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/software/meshtastic-ui/bluetooth_programming_mode.webp"
    alt="Bluetooth Programming Mode"
    width="60%"
  />
</div>

### Exit Bluetooth Programming Mode

Press and hold the Bluetooth icon to reboot the device back into MUI.
