## What is BaseUI?

<img src="/img/configuration/baseui/baseui-01-welcome.jpg" alt="BaseUI Welcome Screen" />

BaseUI is the stock UI interface that's designed to support all devices with screens - making it more intuitive, more capable including new standalone features, and easier to use on a wider range of devices. BaseUI starts a user's journey with Meshtastic and serves as the base or foundation of the experience.

## Supported Devices

All devices with an OLED, EInk, or TFT display will support BaseUI.

## Installation

BaseUI is by default installed on supported devices using the [Meshtastic Web Flasher](https://flasher.meshtastic.org). Select a 2.7+ version firmware. Devices that support [Meshtastic UI](../meshtasticui/) can enable this with the option to use both UIs on their device; switching is performed through their respective menu systems.

## Initial Setup

## Buttons

BaseUI is designed to be navigated with as little as one button but support a myriad of devices from CardKB, Rotary Encoders, Trackballs, and Rocker Switches.
