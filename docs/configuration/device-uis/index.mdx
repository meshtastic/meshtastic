AI SLOP TO FILL THE PAGE FOR NOW -- THIS WILL BE REPLACED.

Meshtastic supports multiple on-device user interfaces (UIs), each designed for different device types, capabilities, and user preferences.  
This section provides an overview of the available UIs and links to detailed documentation for each.

## Available UIs

### [BaseUI](./baseui/)

The standard on-device interface included with Meshtastic firmware. BaseUI provides navigation and access to essential features on supported devices without requiring a phone.

### [MeshtasticUI](./meshtastic-ui/)

Also known as **MUI**, this standalone interface offers a modern, touch-friendly UI for supported devices. It provides enhanced navigation, messaging, mapping, and configuration tools.

### [InkHUD]./inkhud/)

A specialized interface optimized for devices with e-ink displays. InkHUD focuses on low-power operation, high visibility in various lighting conditions, and a simplified layout.

## Choosing the Right UI

When selecting a device UI, consider:

- **Device hardware** — display type, touch capability, and available controls.
- **Features required** — whether you need mapping, advanced messaging, or a minimal display.
- **Power efficiency** — e-ink interfaces like InkHUD are highly power-efficient.

Each UI page in this section includes setup instructions, supported hardware lists, and feature guides.
