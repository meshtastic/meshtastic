This module lets you test the communication range between two Meshtastic nodes. Only nodes with the module enabled will show range test messages on their connected clients.

- Sender: stationary node that sends sequential packets ("Sender message interval" set between 15-60s);
- Receiver: mobile node (typically you) optionally with onboard or phone GPS ("Sender message interval" set to 0)

The sender node sends sequential messages with a hop count of zero at the set interval. The receiver is in direct range of the sender as long as the sequential messages are being received.

The receiving node or client application can be used to save the messages along with the GPS coordinates to a rangetest.csv file. Note that the rangetest.csv may contain your approximate or exact GPS location and uploading it online may allow others to locate you.

To visualize your coverage, you can import the rangetest.csv file into any application or website that directly supports .csv files. The saved .csv file may need to be cleaned up to remove extra/un-needed data rows.  This can be done easily with spreadsheet software like Google Sheets, Libreoffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, and others.

Popular mapping examples that support .csv files directly would be Google Earth Pro, Google My Maps, and OpenStreetMaps uMap. See [Mapping Application Examples](https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/module/range-test/#application-examples) below. Alternatively .csv files can be converted beforehand into other file types that your preferred mapping application supports.

:::info

Be sure to turn off the module or disable sending when not in use. This module uses a lot of air time and will slow down your mesh. The module will automatically turn off after 8 hours.

:::

The range test module config options are: Enabled, Sender, and Save. Range Test Module config uses an admin message sending a `ModuleConfig.RangeTestConfig` protobuf.

## Range Test Module Config Values

### Enabled

Enables the range test module. **Both Sender and Receiver must have the module enabled.** On both Android and Apple apps, the module must be enabled to receive range test messages. The device screen may continue to show range test packets from older firmware versions even if the module is disabled.

### Sender Interval

How long to wait between sending sequential test packets. 0 is the default which disables sending messages.  Receiver node should leave this set as 0.

### Recommended Sender Settings

| Radio Setting | `range_test.sender` |
| :-----------: | :-----------------: |
|   Long Slow   |         60          |
|   Long Fast   |         30          |
|    Medium     |         15          |
|  Short Fast   |         15          |

### Save CSV File

:::info

**Leave disabled when using the Android or Apple apps.** Saves rangetest.csv file directly to the device's flash memory and is only available on ESP32-based devices.

:::

If enabled, all received messages are saved to the ESP32 device's flash memory in a file named `rangetest.csv`.

To access this file, first turn on the WiFi on your device and connect to your network. Once you can connect to your device, navigate to `meshtastic.local/rangetest.csv` (or your_device_ip/rangetest.csv) and the file will be downloaded automatically. This file will only be created after receiving initial messages.

To prevent filling up the storage, the device will abort writing if there is less than 50kb of space on the filesystem.


## Range Test Module Config Client Availability

<Tabs
groupId="settings"
defaultValue="android"
values={[
{label: 'Android', value: 'android'},
{label: 'Apple', value: 'apple'},
{label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
{label: 'Web', value: 'web'},

<TabItem value="android">

#### Android

:::info

Range Test Config options are available for Android.

1. Open the Meshtastic App
2. Navigate to: **Vertical Ellipsis (3 dots top right) > Radio Configuration > Range Test**

:::

Android exports a rangetest.csv file from packets in the Debug Log. To clear old packet history data: `Debug Panel > Clear`  Resulting rangetest.csv may need to be cleaned of unrelated rows.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="apple">

#### Apple

:::info
All range test module config options are available on iOS, iPadOS and macOS at Settings > Module Configuration > Range Test.
:::

Apple apps also have the option to download logged position data which is stored on your iPhone/iPad/Mac.  Access this by clicking on the Nodes tab, selecting a node, then select Position Log and click Save.  This data file does not require the Range Test module to be active.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli">

#### CLI

:::info

Range Test module config options are available in the python CLI. Example commands are below:

:::

|      Setting       |  Acceptable Values  | Default |
| :----------------: | :-----------------: | :-----: |
| range_test.enabled |   `true`, `false`   | `false` |
|  range_test.save   |   `true`, `false`   | `false` |
| range_test.sender  | `integer` (Seconds) |   `0`   |

:::tip

Because the device will reboot after each command is sent via CLI, it is recommended when setting multiple values in a config section that commands be chained together as one.

```shell title="Example:"
meshtastic --set range_test.enabled true --set range_test.save false
```

:::

```shell title="Enable / Disable the range test"
meshtastic --set range_test.enabled true
meshtastic --set range_test.enabled false
```

```shell title="Enable / Disable range test save"
meshtastic --set range_test.save true
meshtastic --set range_test.save false
```

```shell title="Enable range test sender (send every 60 seconds)"
meshtastic --set range_test.sender 60
```

```shell title="Disable range test sender"
meshtastic --set range_test.sender 0
```

</TabItem>

#### Web

:::info

All range test module config options are available in the Web UI.

## Application Examples

### Google Earth Pro Integration

Steps:

1. [Download](https://www.google.com/earth/versions/#download-pro), install, and open Google Earth Pro
   1. Select File > Import
   2. Select CSV
   3. Select Delimited, Comma
   4. Make sure the button that states “This dataset does not contain latitude/longitude information, but street addresses” is unchecked
   5. Select “rx lat” & “rx long” for the appropriate lat/lng fields
   6. Click finish
2. When it prompts you to create a style template, click yes.
   1. Set the name field to whichever column you want to be displayed on the map (don’t worry about this too much, when you click on an icon, all the relevant data appears)
   2. Select a color, icon, etc. and hit OK.

Your data will load onto the map, make sure to click the checkbox next to your dataset in the sidebar to view it.

### Google My Maps

You can use [Google My Maps](http://mymaps.google.com). It accepts imported .csv files and the whole interface is rather easy to work with.

Google has instructions on how to do that [here](https://support.google.com/mymaps/answer/3024836?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en#zippy=%2Cstep-prepare-your-info%2Cstep-import-info-into-the-map).

You can style the ranges differently based on the values, so you can have the pins be darker the if the SNR or RSSI (if that gets added) is higher.

### OpenStreetMap - uMap

For an open source solution you could use [uMap](https://umap.openstreetmap.de/en/). A service based on the popular OpenStreetMap project.

Visit [uMap](https://umap.openstreetmap.de/en/) in your preferred language. 
1. Click on "Create a map"
2. Click on the "Import data"-Icon or press CTRL + I.
3. Choose your rangetest.csv and click "Import". The data format is recognized and the locations are imported onto the map.
