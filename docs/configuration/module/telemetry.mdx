description: This module allows sharing of Device, Environment, Health, and Air Quality metrics from your Meshtastic device.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

The Telemetry Module provides four types of data over the mesh: Device metrics (Battery Level, Voltage, Channel Utilization and Airtime) from your Meshtastic device, Environment Metrics, Air Quality Metrics, and Health metrics (Heart rate, Oxygen Saturation and body temperature).

Supported sensors connected to the I2C bus of the device will be automatically detected at startup. The Environment Telemetry, Air Quality, and Health Telemetry modules must be enabled for them to be instrumented and their readings sent over the mesh.

:::tip

Because the device will reboot after each command is sent via CLI, it is recommended when setting multiple values in a config section that commands be chained together as one.

```shell title="Example:"
meshtastic --set telemetry.device_update_interval 0 --set telemetry.environment_update_interval 0
```

:::

```shell title="Set module update intervals (Default of 0 is 5 Minutes)"
meshtastic --set telemetry.device_update_interval 0
// Device Metrics Two Minutes
meshtastic --set telemetry.device_update_interval 0
// Environment Metrics Two Minutes
meshtastic --set telemetry.environment_update_interval 120
```

```shell title="Enable/Disable Environment Module"
meshtastic --set telemetry.environment_measurement_enabled true
meshtastic --set telemetry.environment_measurement_enabled false
```

```shell title="Enable/Disable on device screen"
meshtastic --set telemetry.environment_screen_enabled true
meshtastic --set telemetry.environment_screen_enabled false
```

```shell title="Enable / Disable Display Fahrenheit"
meshtastic --set telemetry.environment_display_fahrenheit true
meshtastic --set telemetry.environment_display_fahrenheit false

## Examples

### RAK 4631 with BME680 Environment Sensor

Setup of a RAK 4631 with Environment Sensor

[<img src="RAK4631_with_EnvSensor" src="/img/hardware/rak/RAK4631_with_EnvSensor.webp" style={{zoom:'25%'}} />](/img/hardware/rak/RAK4631_with_EnvSensor.webp)

Requirements:

- RAK4631
- Environment Sensor

Steps:

- configure the device:

```shell
meshtastic --set telemetry.environment_measurement_enabled true --set telemetry.environment_screen_enabled true --set telemetry.environment_display_fahrenheit true
```

:::tip

While the above values serve as an example and can be modified to fit your specific needs, it is advisable to chain multiple commands together, as demonstrated in the example. This approach will minimize the number of necessary reboots.

:::

- Device will reboot after command is sent.
- When the device boots again it should say "Telemetry" and it may show the sensor data
- If this does not appear to have any effects, run:

```shell
meshtastic --noproto
```

And examine the serial logs for Telemetry diagnostic information.

## Supporting Additional Sensors

### Environment Metrics

The environment metrics in the telemetry module supports a limited amount of fields as they are stored in memory on the device. Support for sensors that provide one or more of the following fields can potentially be added to the main firmware provided there is a GPL licensed library for us to include to support it, and the library size is not prohibitive.

- Temperature
- Relative Humidity
- Barometric Pressure
- Gas Resistance (AQI)
- Voltage
- Current

### Supporting Other Sensor types

For other interesting sensor types and use cases we need to add a portnum for more generic telemetry packets and a second MCU will be required to interact with the sensor and process the data to be sent over the mesh. This data will not be stored in the nodedb on the device.
