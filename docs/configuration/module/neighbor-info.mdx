The Neighbor Info Module is for sending information on each node's 0-hop neighbors to the mesh. Config options are: Enabled and Update Interval. 

In order to save bandwidth, Meshtastic does not keep track of the route a packet is taking to get to the destination, except when using Traceroute. When enabling this module, your node will periodically send out a packet with a list of its direct neighbors and the quality (SNR) of the corresponding link. If you enable this on all nodes, you can build up a graph of the full network to see how it is connected. At the time of writing, there are no clients visualizing it for you, but you can use e.g. MQTT to gather all the data.

In order to use it, make sure your devices use firmware version 2.2.0 or higher.

## Neighbor Info Module Config Values
