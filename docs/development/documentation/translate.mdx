## How to Contribute

Contributing translations to the Meshtastic Documentation helps make the project accessible to a wider audience. Follow these steps to add your translations through Crowdin:

1. **Access Crowdin**: Visit the Meshtastic project's Crowdin page at [https://crowdin.meshtastic.org](https://crowdin.meshtastic.org).
2. **Create an Account**: Click on 'Sign Up' in the top right corner of the page and follow the prompts to create a Crowdin account.
3. **Navigate to the Project**: Once logged in, locate and select the 'Docs' project from the Crowdin dashboard.
4. **Choose a Language**: Find the language you want to contribute translations for and select it. A list of the files that make up the Meshtastic documentation site will be shown. Select the file you want to translate, then click the 'Go to Editor' button at the top to start translating.
5. **Start Translating**: In the editor, you'll see the file you are translating on the left-hand side. Items that can be translated, typically broken up by sentences, will be highlighted in red. Click on an item to select it, the highlight color will change to yellow to indicate it's selected. Then, enter your translation in the editor box on the right-hand side. When you're finished with an item (sentence), click 'Save' to store your translation. Repeat this process for each item you wish to translate.

Your contribution will be reviewed, and upon approval, your translation will be included in the Meshtastic documentation. Thank you for helping expand the reach of Meshtastic!
