## Build instructions

If you would like to develop this application we'd love your help! These build instructions are brief and should be improved, please send a PR if you can.

- Use Android Studio to build/debug
- Use `git submodule update --init --recursive` to pull in the various submodules we depend on
- There are a few config files which you'll need to copy from templates included in the project. Run the following commands to do so:
```sh
rm ./app/google-services.json
cp ./app/google-services-example.json ./app/google-services.json
rm ./app/src/main/res/values/curfirmwareversion.xml
cp ./app/special/curfirmwareversion.xml ./app/src/main/res/values/
```

- Now you should be able to select "Run / Run" in the IDE and it will happily start running on your phone or the emulator.

:::note
The emulators don't support Bluetooth, so some features can not be used in that environment.

## Analytics setup

- Analytics are included but can be disabled by the user on the settings screen
- On dev devices

adb shell setprop debug.firebase.analytics.app com.geeksville.mesh
adb shell setprop log.tag.FirebaseCrashlytics DEBUG
```

for verbose logging:

```sh
adb shell setprop log.tag.FA VERBOSE
```

## Publishing to google play
