## Build instructions

If you would like to develop this application we'd love your help! These build instructions are brief and should be improved, please send a PR if you can.

1. Use Android Studio to build/debug
2. Clone the repository and after successful cloning, change the working directory to Meshtastic-Android/
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-Android.git && cd Meshtastic-Android/
   ```
3. Pull in the various sub-modules we depend on.
   ```shell
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
4. Now you should be able to select "Run / Run" in the IDE and it will happily start running on your phone or the emulator.

:::note
The emulators don't support Bluetooth, so some features can not be used in that environment.
