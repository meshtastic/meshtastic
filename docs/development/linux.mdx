The device software can also run on a native Linux machine thanks to the [Portduino framework](https://github.com/meshtastic/framework-portduino).

The application either simulates some of the interfaces, or uses the real hardware of your machine.
Device firmware from 1.3.42 and on even allows you to simulate the LoRa chip by sending and receiving Meshtastic packets via a local TCP port.
In this way, you can let multiple instances of the application communicate with each other as if they did via LoRa.
For instructions on how to use it, see the [interactive simulator](https://github.com/GUVWAF/Meshtasticator/blob/master/INTERACTIVE_SIM.md) that also emulates a wireless environment using simulated positions of the nodes.

## Building

The easiest way of building the native application is using Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO extension.
See the [instructions for creating such a building environment](/docs/development/firmware/build).

Then after opening the firmware repository in Visual Studio Code, simply click on the PlatformIO extension in the left bar, select `native` and click on 'Build'.
This will generate the binary file 'meshtasticd' which you can find in `.pio/build/native/`.
Once in this directory or when you copied the file to your current directory, launch the application with `./meshtasticd`.
