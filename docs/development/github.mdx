description: How the Meshtastic Project uses GitHub
---
The Meshtastic project uses GitHub for its version control system,
[discussion forums](https://github.com/orgs/meshtastic/discussions), and issue tracking.

[Contributions](/docs/contributing/) are welcome from anyone, and we have a [Meshtastic organisation](https://github.com/orgs/meshtastic), 
to manage overarching settings for our 100+ repositories, and manage the access that release
managers, CI/CD admins, security team members, and core contributors require to perform
their functions.

## GitHub Actions
We use GitHub Actions for CI (testing), and CD (releasing) across many
projects (E.g. firmware, web, android, python, openwrt). GitHub provides 20 runner slots to
run actions on their infrastructure and we supplement the capacity by running self-hosted
runners.

### Requirement for Self-Hosted Runners
If you're interested in contributing runners and can meet the requirements
below, please send us a message in the #hosting channel on discord.

#### Hardware Requirements [for 1 runner]
- Able to run a build within 10mins (i.e. CPU less than 7 years old)
- Min 2 CPUs, Min 4GB Ram, but 4+ CPU/8GB+ RAM preferred
- Min 15GB HDD, 30+GB preferred

#### Firewall requirements
- Able to download and upload on port 80 and 443

#### Current network usage
- 20GB of inbound traffic per day
- 1GB of outbound traffic per day

#### Operating System
- We have tested modern Ubuntu and Fedora
- However other *nix distributions that support running podman images probably work

#### Security requirements
- Regular operating system patches 
- Single non-root user account to run podman container
- Policy and security measures in place to protect secrets and build artefacts

#### Reliability requirements
A failed job due to a runner failure really annoys the developers, and only a
 few people can re-start the failed jobs, so reliability is very important 🙂
In the past we had used desktops at home, but they kept getting network dropouts,
power outages, re-purposed machines for other things, filling up hard disks, etc.
So, we prefer datacentre-based hosting with reliable cooling, power, network.
