The Meshtastic QR code (or Channel URL) allows users to quickly share channel and LoRa settings, making it easy to configure multiple nodes with matching settings for communication. Scanning a QR code applies all included channel settings and LoRa configuration settings, so be sure to review what these settings include before proceeding. Only scan QR codes from trusted sources.
