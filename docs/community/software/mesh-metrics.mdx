Mesh-metrics is a script that uses the meshtastic-cli and a device connected by usb to send metrics-requests from a list of devices and output the results in a format to be ingested by node_exporter to populate a Prometheus/Victoria Metrics Time series DB. Along with the script, a Grafana dashboard and some alert examples are included. Mesh-metrics was created and is maintained by cordel and more information on its use and setup can be found on the [Mesh-metrics GitHub page](https://github.com/cordelster/mesh-metrics)
