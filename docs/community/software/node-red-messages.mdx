## Overview

This [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) node allows sending and receiving packets to a Meshtastic mesh network thru a device connected via HTTP.
It is based on [Meshtastic.js](https://js.meshtastic.org/) library.

## Features
- Send and receive text messages to/from any device in the mesh
- Supervise/monitor device status
- Subscribe and receive all types of events supported by [Meshtastic.js](https://js.meshtastic.org/) (examples: Atak, Position, Range Test, Map Report, Store and Forward, etc...)
- Send packets to any Meshtastic APP (port num)
- Plug and Play: no additional servers, no containers, no CLI, no binary files, super simple configuration
- Indirect support to MQTT via uplink/downlink channels

## Limitations
- Connect directly to the MQTT server: this is not supported by [Meshtastic.js](https://js.meshtastic.org/)
- Connect to a device via Bluetooth or Serial (not implemented yet)

## Instructions
For installation and usage instructions, please visit the project page at [GitHub](https://github.com/danpeig/node-red-meshtastic-msg).
