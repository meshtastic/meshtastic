## Overview

This [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) node allows sending and receiving packets to a Meshtastic mesh network thru a device connected via HTTP, HTTPS or serial port
It is based on [Meshtastic Web](https://github.com/meshtastic/web) library.

## Features
- Send and receive text messages to/from any device in the mesh
- Supervise/monitor device status
- Subscribe and receive all types of events supported by [[Meshtastic Web](https://github.com/meshtastic/web) (examples: Atak, Position, Range Test, Map Report, Store and Forward, etc...)
- Send packets to any Meshtastic APP (port num)
- Plug and Play: no additional servers, no containers, no CLI, no binary files, super simple configuration
- Indirect support to MQTT via uplink/downlink channels
- HTTP, HTTPS and serial connections supported

## Limitations
- Connect directly to the MQTT server: this is not supported by [Meshtastic Web](https://github.com/meshtastic/web)
- Connect to a device via Bluetooth: this is not supported by [Meshtastic Web](https://github.com/meshtastic/web)
