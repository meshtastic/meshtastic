# Harbor Scale Meshtastic Integration

The Meshtastic Integration allows you to connect your Meshtastic LoRa mesh to Harbor Scale effortlessly using the **Harbor Lighthouse** agent. Unlike previous methods that required manual Python scripts, the new agent handles device detection, data parsing, and secure transmission automatically.

## Features

- **Single Binary Agent**: No Python environments or dependencies to manage.
- **Mesh Engine**: Automatically decodes packets from the entire mesh, not just the local node.
- **Auto-Discovery**: Detects connected USB devices automatically.
- **Resilient**: Buffers data if the internet goes down and reconnects automatically.
- **Grafana Compatibility**: Visualize battery, SNR, RSSI, and environmental data in rich dashboards.

## How to Use

### 1. Prepare Your Meshtastic Device
* Ensure your Meshtastic device is connected via USB and operational.
* Note the COM port (optional, as the agent usually auto-detects it).

---

### 2. Install the Agent & Engine

Run the appropriate command for your system. This installs both the main **Lighthouse** agent and the specific **Meshtastic driver**.

**Linux / macOS / Raspberry Pi:**
```bash
curl -sL get.harborscale.com | sudo bash && curl -sL get.harborscale.com/meshtastic | sudo bash
```

> *Requires sudo privileges. You may be asked for a password.*

**Windows (PowerShell Administrator):**

```powershell
iwr get.harborscale.com | iex; iwr get.harborscale.com/meshtastic | iex

```

### 3. Connect the Gateway

Use the `lighthouse` command to start the bridge. Replace the ID and Key with your credentials from the Harbor Scale dashboard.

```bash
lighthouse --add \
  --name "meshtastic-gateway" \
  --harbor-id "YOUR_HARBOR_ID" \
  --key "YOUR_API_KEY" \
  --source exec \
  --param command="mesh_engine --ttl 3600"

```

* **`--ttl 3600`**: (Optional) Drops nodes from the report if they haven't been heard for 1 hour.
* **`--port`**: (Optional) Add `--port /dev/ttyUSB0` inside the quotes if auto-detection fails.

---

### 4. Stream Data

The agent will now run in the background as a system service. It continuously pushes telemetry data from your mesh to the Harbor Scale API endpoint.

---

### 5. Visualize in Grafana

* Log in to your Harbor Scale Grafana instance.
* Access pre-configured dashboards to view and analyze your Meshtastic data.
