The Meshtastic ecosystem is highly extensible, and a number of community projects have been made to fit different people's needs. If you wish to create your own application or module, please read the information in the developers section, and tell us about your project on the forum.

Current community projects:

- [Meshtastic Web API](/docs/community/software/meshtastic-web-api) - Meshtastic Web API provides a RESTful interface to interact with a Meshtastic node via a serial connection.
- [Mesh-metrics](/docs/community/software/community-mesh-metrics) - Meshtastic repeater metrics scraper using meshtastic-cli to be ingested by node_exporter for use in Prometheus or Victoria Metrics Time series DB with a Grafana dashboard and sample alerting rules.
- [Node-RED Messages Node](/docs/community/software/community-node-red-messages) - Node-RED node to send and receive packets / text messages from a device connected via HTTP.
- [MQTT Connect for Meshtastic](https://github.com/pdxlocations/MQTT-Connect-for-Meshtastic) - A nodeless python client for communicating with Meshtastic devices over MQTT.

Support for these projects should be sought from their respective authors.
