## Identify Hardware

:::note

This guide assumes that you have already purchased the devices you will be using with Meshtastic. If you haven't, you can check out our list of [supported hardware](/docs/hardware/devices/index.mdx)
to see your options.
:::

Before you begin, it's important to determine which kind of hardware you're using. Meshtastic works with devices that have these types of Micro-Controller Units (MCU):

### ESP32

The ESP32 chip is older and consumes more power than the nRF52 chip, but is equipped with both WiFi and Bluetooth. Supported ESP32 devices include:

- LILYGO® TTGO T-Beam (>V1.1 recommended)
- LILYGO® TTGO Lora (>V2.1 recommended)
- Nano G1
- Station G1
- Heltec V3 and Wireless Stick Lite V3
- RAK11200 Core module for RAK WisBlock modular boards

### nRF52

The nRF52 chip is much more power efficient than the ESP32 chip and easier to update, but is only equipped with Bluetooth. Supported nRF52 devices include:

- RAK4631 Core module for RAK WisBlock modular boards
- LILYGO® TTGO T-Echo

### RP2040

The RP2040 is a dual-core ARM chip developed by Raspberry Pi. Supported RP2040 devices include:

 - Raspberry Pi Pico + Waveshare LoRa Module (Note: **Bluetooth on the Pico W is not yet supported by Meshtastic**)
 - RAK11310 Core module for RAK WisBlock modular boards

:::info

If your device is not listed above, please review our [supported devices](/docs/hardware/devices/index.mdx) to determine which MCU your device has or contact us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/ktMAKGBnBs) with any questions.

:::danger STOP! Put The Power Cable Down!

Never power on the radio without attaching an antenna as doing so could damage the radio chip!

:::

Prior to connecting your Meshtastic device to the computer, you should perform the following basic checks.

### Verify Data Cable

Some cables only provide _charging_, verify that your cable is also capable of _transferring data_ before proceeding. To check if your cable can also transfer data, try connecting it to another device (like a phone) and see if you can copy a file to or from it. If the file transfer works, then your cable is also able to transfer data and you can continue.

### Install Serial Drivers

:::caution

nRF52/RP2040 devices typically do not require serial drivers. They use the UF2 bootloader which makes the devices appear as flash drives.  Do _NOT_ download the USB device drivers unless required to install UF2 support.

:::

If you require serial drivers installed on your computer, please choose one of the options below and install it before continuing.

### Flash Firmware

After completing the previous steps, you can now flash the Meshtastic firmware onto your device. To proceed, select the appropriate device type for your device.

    <div className="split-item">
      <Link
        className={"button button--outline button--lg cta--button"}
        to={"/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/esp32/"}
      >
