## Prerequisites

### Device connectivity

Ensure your computer is communicating with the device correctly by following [these instructions](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/).

### Download Latest Firmware

Firmware can be downloaded from the [Downloads](/downloads) page. Your initial installation has to happen over USB from your Mac, Windows, or Linux computer. Over the air updates are currently only available using the Android application after this initial installation.

### WisBlock RAK4631 Bootloader

Please ensure that you have updated the bootloader to the latest version using the information on the [RAK Documentation Center](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631/Quickstart/#how-to-check-if-you-have-the-updated-rak4631-bootloader) website.

:::tip
[Meshtastic Flasher](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/meshtastic-flasher) can assist you in updating the bootloader to the latest version.

## Install/Update Firmware

:::caution
Be careful to install the correct load for your board. While it is unlikely that you will cause damage to your device, the wrong firmware will cause it to not work.
:::

- Connect your device to your computer with a USB cable. If your computer complains about needing to format a new drive, cancel the format command.
- Double click the `Reset` button on your device, this will put it into bootloader mode.

- A new drive will then be mounted on your computer. Open this drive and you should see three files: `CURRENT.UF2`, `INDEX.HTM`, and `INFO_UF2.TXT`
- Copy the appropriate `firmware-xxxxx-1.2.x.uf2` file from the firmware zip file onto the new drive.

:::note
You are going to copy/drop "as is" 'firmware-xxxxx-1.2.x.uf2' (_NOT_ over the "CURRENT.UF2" file) in the volume, and the device reboot will copy it/load it correctly.
:::

- Once the file has finished copying over, the device will reboot, loading the new firmware as it does.
