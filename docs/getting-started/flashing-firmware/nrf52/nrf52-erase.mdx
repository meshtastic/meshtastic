Meshtastic uses the [littlefs](https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs) library to store configuration, logs, and other data in the internal flash of nRF52 & RP2040 devices. Updating the firmware does _not_ erase this additional data, which can cause issues when the format and location of data changes between releases.

:::info
You may now use the [Meshtastic Web Flasher](https://flasher.mesthastic.org) to Factory Erase your nRF52 or RP2040-based devices.  Visit the flasher, select your board, and click the trash can icon to the right of the Flash button. This will open a dialogue to begin the erase procedure. 

Alternatively, follow the instructions below.

### nRF52

To reset the flash storage on your nRF52 board:

1. Download and unzip the latest firmware from [Meshtastic Downloads](https://meshtastic.org/downloads).
2. Connect your device to your computer with a USB data cable.
3. Double click the reset button on your device (this will put it into bootloader mode)
4. Notice a new drive will be mounted on your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
5. Open this drive and you should see three files: `CURRENT.UF2`, `INDEX.HTM`, and `INFO_UF2.TXT`
6. Find the file included in the downloaded firmware named `Meshtastic_nRF52_factory_erase.uf2` and copy it onto the new drive. The device should reboot.
7. With the [Meshtastic CLI](/docs/software/python/cli/) installed, open your Terminal/Console and enter the command: `meshtastic --noproto`.
8. Press any key, you should see the message: `Formatting... Done`.

Once the device has been erased, you can proceed to install the latest Meshtastic firmware on a clean storage filesystem by clicking the link below.

### RP2040

To reset the flash storage on your RP2040 board:

1. Download [flash_nuke.uf2](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/soft/flash_nuke.uf2) to your computer.
2. Press the BOOTSEL button and while keeping it pressed, connect it to your computer via a USB cable.
3. The board should now appear as a mass storage device on your computer with the label RPI-RP2.
4. Copy the flash_nuke.uf2 file to the device.
5. The board will now restart and the flash memory will be erased.
