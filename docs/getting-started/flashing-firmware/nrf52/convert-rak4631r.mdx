description: Instructions for converting the RAK4631-R to RAK-4631 using Python and adafruit-nrfutil.
---

The only difference between the _RAK4631-R_ (RUI3) and the _RAK4631_ (Arduino) is the bootloader it is shipped with - the hardware is the same.

Meshtastic requires the Arduino bootloader on RAK WisBlock nRF52-based boards. The process of converting the bootloader only needs to be performed once.

Here are two ways to flash the bootloader:

## USB Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU)

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [adafruit-nrfutil](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_nrfutil)
   ```shell
   pip3 install adafruit-nrfutil
   ```
3. Download the required bootloader: [WisCore_RAK4631_Board_Bootloader.zip](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/releases/download/0.4.2/WisCore_RAK4631_Board_Bootloader.zip)
4. Connect your RAK device by USB.
5. Flash the bootloader
   ```shell
   adafruit-nrfutil --verbose dfu serial --package ./WisCore_RAK4631_Board_Bootloader.zip  -p /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200 --singlebank --touch 1200
   ```
   Note: The serial port name (`/dev/ttyACM0`) may differ depending on your operating system. Make sure to identify the correct port name for your setup.
6. Continue with the normal [flashing instructions](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/drag-n-drop)

### Extra RUI3 Steps

If the above steps fail with errors like:

```bash
Touched serial port COM11
Opened serial port COM11
Starting DFU upgrade of type 2, SoftDevice size: 0, bootloader size: 39000, application size: 0
Sending DFU start packet
Timed out waiting for acknowledgement from device.
Failed to upgrade target. Error is: No data received on serial port. Not able to proceed.
```

You will need to follow the first part (through the `AT+BOOT` command) of the [Converting RAK4631-R to RAK4631](https://docs.rakwireless.com/product-categories/wisblock/rak4631-r/dfu/#converting-rak4631-r-to-rak4631) instructions.

## Debugger

This conversion requires the use of either a [DAPLink](https://daplink.io/) or [J-Link](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/). The most reasonably priced and available is the [RAKDAP1](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/daplink-tool).

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [pyOCD](https://pyocd.io/)
   ```shell
   pip3 install pyocd
   ```
3. Download the required bootloader: [WisCore_RAK4631_Board_Bootloader.hex](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/releases/download/0.4.2/WisCore_RAK4631_Board_Bootloader.hex)
4. Connect the RAKDAP as follows:
   [<img src="/img/rak4631-rakdap1.webp" style={{zoom:'25%'}} />](/img/rak4631-rakdap1.webp)
5. Flash the bootloader
   ```shell
   pyocd flash -t nrf52840 .\WisCore_RAK4631_Board_Bootloader.hex
   ```
6. Continue with the normal [flashing instructions](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/drag-n-drop)

Alternate methods of flashing are outlined [here](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/bootloader/RAK4630).
