## Flash Firmware

:::info
You may now use the [Meshtastic Web Flasher](https://flasher.mesthastic.org) to download and copy firmware to your nRF52 or RP2040-based devices. Alternatively, follow the instructions below to download and install firmware.
:::

### nRF52

1. Download and unzip the latest firmware from [Meshtastic Downloads](https://meshtastic.org/downloads).
2. Connect your device to your computer with a USB data cable.
3. Double click the reset button on your device (this will put it into bootloader mode).
4. Notice a new drive will be mounted on your computer (Windows, Mac, Linux, or Android).
5. Open this drive and you should see three files: `CURRENT.UF2`, `INDEX.HTM`, and `INFO_UF2.TXT`.
6. Copy the appropriate firmware file (`firmware-DEVICE_NAME-X.X.X-xxxxxxx.uf2`) from the release onto this drive.
7. Once the file has finished copying onto the drive, the device will reboot and install the Meshtastic firmware.

### RP2040
1. Download and unzip the latest firmware from [Meshtastic Downloads](https://meshtastic.org/downloads).
2. Press the BOOTSEL button and while keeping it pressed, connect the device to your computer via a USB cable.
3. Notice a new drive will be mounted on your computer (Windows, Mac, Linux, or Android).
4. Open this drive and you should see two files: `INDEX.HTM` and `INFO_UF2.TXT`.
5. Copy the appropriate firmware file (`firmware-DEVICE_NAME-X.X.X-xxxxxxx.uf2`) from the release onto this drive.
6. Once the file has finished copying onto the drive, the device will reboot and install the Meshtastic firmware.

### Potential Flashing Edge Cases

:::info

Before flashing confirm that you have [RAK4631](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631/) and not a [RAK4631-R](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/) If this is not the case, fear not. The hardware is identical but requires changing the bootloader. Instructions on how to do this are located [here](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/convert-rak4631r).

:::

:::info

Previous versions of the Meshtastic firmware may save stale data, causing devices to get stuck in a crash loop during startup. If you experience issues when upgrading your nRF52 device from a previous version of Meshtastic, you may need to perform a full factory reset of the internal flash memory.

Follow the guide to [factory erase your nRF52](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/nrf52-erase) device before continuing to [flash firmware](#flash-firmware).
