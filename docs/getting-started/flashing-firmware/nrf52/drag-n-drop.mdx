:::info
Before flashing confirm that you have [RAK4631](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631/) and not a [RAK4631-R](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/) If this is not the case, fear not. The hardware is identical but requires changing the bootloader. Instructions on how to do this are located [here](/docs/guides/convert-rak4631r).

## Upgrading from a previous version of Meshtastic

If you are upgrading your NRF52 device from a previous version of Meshtastic rather than starting from scratch, you may need to do a full factory reset of the internal flash memory. Stale data saved by previous versions of the Meshtastic firmware can cause devices to get stuck in a crash loop at startup.

Follow the guide to [factory erase your NRF52](/docs/guides/nrf52-erase) device before continuing to [flash firmware](#flash-firmware).


## Flash Firmware

Download and unzip the latest firmware from [Meshtastic Downloads](https://meshtastic.org/downloads).

1. Connect your device to your computer with a USB data cable.
2. Double click the reset button on your device (this will put it into bootloader mode) 
3. Notice a new drive will be mounted on your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
4. Open this drive and you should see three files: `CURRENT.UF2`, `INDEX.HTM`, and `INFO_UF2.TXT`
5. Drop the appropriate firmware file (`firmware-DEVICE_NAME-vx.x.x-xxxxxxx.uf2`) from the release onto this drive.

Once the file has finished copying onto the drive, the device will reboot and install the Meshtastic firmware.
