nRF52 devices from RAK are able to accept OTA firmware updates from a mobile device over bluetooth. Older T-Echo bootloaders do not have OTA support.

:::caution

OTA firmware updates come with an increased risk of failure. If the update process fails, your device will be left in a non-working state and require physical access for intervention.

#### Android

OTA firmware updates are available for Android using the nRF DFU application in the Play Store.

1. Download the firmware release you wish to install from the [Meshtastic Download Page](/downloads), [Meshtastic GitHub](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/releases)
2. Unzip the firmware folder
3. Open the nRF DFU App and select the correct device firmware file (will end with -ota.zip)
4. Connect to your device
5. Upload the firmware (this will take a while)

#### Apple

OTA firmware updates are available on iOS & iPadOS using the nRF Device Firmware Update App available through the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nrf-device-firmware-update/id1624454660)

1. Download the firmware release you wish to install from the [Meshtastic Download Page](/downloads), [Meshtastic GitHub](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/releases), or via the iOS or iPadOS app.
2. Unzip the firmware folder
3. Open the nRF DFU App and select the correct device firmware file (will end with -ota.zip)
4. Connect to your device
5. Upload the firmware (this will take a while)

The iPhone's auto-lock feature could potentially interrupt the Bluetooth firmware upload. To avoid this, occasionally tap on your screen, or temporarily set the auto-lock to "Never" during the upload process to ensure that the phone stays awake and the upload completes without interruption.

If the update fails, you may find that adjusting the packet settings can help:

1. In settings, enable "**Packets Receipt Notification**". 
2. Change "**Number of Packets**" to a lower value. Some users report success with "5".
