nRF52 devices from RAK are able to accept OTA firmware updates from a mobile device over bluetooth. Older T-Echo bootloaders do not have OTA support.


:::caution

OTA firmware updates come with an increased risk of failure. If the update process fails, your device will be left in a non-working state and require physical access for intervention.
