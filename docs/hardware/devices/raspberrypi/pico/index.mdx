The Raspberry Pi Pico series is a range of tiny, fast, and versatile boards built using RP2040, the flagship microcontroller chip designed by Raspberry Pi in the UK.

:::info

Only the Pico W has WiFi/BLE capabilities. Meshtastic supports WiFi on the Pico W (although no web server and HTTP API), but does not currently support BLE.
