## Nano G2 Ultra

The Nano G2 Ultra and Nano G1 Explorer have exactly the same Lora front-end circuit design and internal wideband Lora antenna. The primary design goal of the Nano G2 Ultra is to reduce power consumption and improve battery life by using the low power MCU NRF52840. The typical battery life is optimized to be about 3.5 days. As with the Nano G1 Explorer, the Nano G2 Ultra's design also takes into account the potential impact of the human body on its antenna performance, ensuring optimal RF performance even when carried in a pocket.

### Specifications

- **MCU:**
  - NRF52840
    - Bluetooth 5.4
- **LoRa Transceiver:**
  - Semtech SX1262
- **Frequency Options:**
  - _US (902.0Mhz to 928.0Mhz), EU_868 (869.4Mhz to 869.65Mhz), JP (920.8Mhz to 927.8Mhz), ANZ (915.0Mhz to 928.0Mhz), RU (868.7Mhz to 869.2Mhz), KR (920.0Mhz to 923.0Mhz), TW (920.0Mhz to 925.0Mhz), IN (865.0Mhz to 867.0Mhz), NZ_865 (864.0Mhz to 868.0Mhz), TH (920.0Mhz to 925.0Mhz), UA_868 (868.0Mhz to 868.6Mhz), MY_919 (919.0Mhz to 924.0Mhz), SG_923 (917.0Mhz to 925.0Mhz)._
- **Navigation Module:**
  - ATGM336H-5N-71 (Supports GPS, BDS and GLONASS)
- **Antenna:**
  - New internal wide-band antenna with optimized wide-band LoRa RF frontend circuit.
- **Connectors:**
  - USB-C

### Features

- Meshtastic pre-installed.
- New internal GPS antenna that significantly reduces GPS lock time compared to the Nano G1. Additionally, the GPS module can be set to a low-power mode with the GPS physical switch.
- Integrated enhanced message notification circuit for LED or Buzzer, configurable via physical switches.
- Physical power switch to easily turn the device on/off.
- Replaceable 1.3" OLED screen with a FPC connector.
- Internal Li-Polymer Battery Charger. _(An optional 3.7V 603450 JST 1.25mm Rechargeable Li-Polymer Battery can also be installed.)_
- Buck-boost converter to provide stable 3.3V to the system even in the event the Li-Polymer battery voltage drops to as low as 2.5V. Supply voltage stability is very important to ensure that the performance of RF circuits meets design expectations.
- NXP PCF8563 Real Time Clock (RTC)
- Optional I2C Extension Board (1x GROVE I2C Socket and 1x SparkFun QWIIC I2C Socket for Sensors and Keyboard)
