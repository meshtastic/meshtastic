## V3/V3.1

::::info
This device may have issues charging a connected battery if utilizing a USB-C to USB-C cable. It's recommended to use a USB-A to USB-C cable.

:::caution
Be careful when interacting with the USB-C port. This device does not have ESD protection for the CP2102 USB to UART bridge chip.

- **MCU:**
  - ESP32-S3FN8 (WiFi & Bluetooth)
- **LoRa Transceiver:**
  - Semtech SX1262
- **Frequency Options:**
  - 433 MHz
  - 470 - 510 MHz
  - 863 - 870 MHz
  - 902 - 928 MHz
- **Connectors:**
  - USB-C
  - Antenna:
    - Dedicated 2.4 GHz metal spring antenna for WiFi/Bluetooth
    - U.FL/IPEX antenna connector for LoRa

### V3.1 differences

Firmware remains the same as V3 below. Compare schematics: [V3.0](<https://web.archive.org/web/20221127054612/https://resource.heltec.cn/download/WiFi_LoRa32_V3/HTIT-WB32LA(F)_V3_Schematic_Diagram.pdf>) and [V3.1](<https://resource.heltec.cn/download/WiFi_LoRa_32_V3/HTIT-WB32LA(F)_V3.1_Schematic_Diagram.pdf>). Key differences:

- Removal of [FDG6322C](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/308/1/FDG6322C_D-2312203.pdf) (a dual N & P channel FET) from the V3.1 power supply.
- Antenna filter values in V3.1 (L11 = 1.8pF, C15 = 2.7nH, C24 = 1.8pF) align more closely with ESP32-S3 reference design than V3.0 (L11 = 1.6nH, C15 = 6.9pF, C24 = 2.4pF).

### Features

- Built in 0.96 inch OLED display
- User and Reset Buttons
- No GPS

### Meshtastic I2C Definitions

- SDA: GPIO41
- SCL: GPIO42
