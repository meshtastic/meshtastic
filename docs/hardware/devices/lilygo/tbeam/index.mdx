All T-beam models (with the exception of the S3-Core) have an 18650 size battery holder on the rear of the device. This is designed to the original specification of the 18650 and only fits unprotected flat top 18650 cells. Button top and protected cells are typically longer than 65mm, often approaching 70mm.

Further information on the LILYGO® T-Beam devices can be found on LILYGO®'s [GitHub page](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-LoRa-Series).

### Flashing

To flash ESP32-S3 devices like the T-Beam Supreme, you typically need to place them in Espressif's firmware download mode. Use the "1200bps reset" button in the web flasher to do this. If this method does not work for any reason, you can follow the manual process below.

:::warning

Do not proceed unless an antenna is connected to avoid possible damage to the device's radio.

:::

The following process will manually place the device into the Espressif Firmware Download mode:

1. Unplug the device.
2. Press and hold the BOOT button.
3. Plug device in.
4. After 2-3 seconds, release the BOOT button.

With the device now in the Espressif Firmware Download mode, you can proceed with flashing using one of the supported flashing methods. It's generally recommended to use the [Web Flasher](https://flasher.meshtastic.org/). You can select "Tbeam S3 Core from the device drop-down.
