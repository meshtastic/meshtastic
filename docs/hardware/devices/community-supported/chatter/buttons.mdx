Each button can be pressed up to 4 times in quick succession to access the second third and fourth character listed under it.
The shift button cycle between lowercase letters, uppercase, and numbers.

The top/left button (labelled UP/LEFT) is assigned to UP and allows the user to access preregistered canned messages (SELECT to send and CANCEL to go back).
The next button (labelled DOWN/RIGHT) is assigned to RIGHT.
The BACKSPACE button is assigned to the TAB function when SHIFT has been pressed once.
To select a destination, use the TAB button (press SHIFT once then BACKSPACE) to highlight the destination field. Then use the RIGHT key to cycle through available destinations. (Press SHIFT again to return the first function of each key)

Simply starting to type a text using the letter key will automatically open a free text input panel and allow the user to write the message to send using the SELECT key.
