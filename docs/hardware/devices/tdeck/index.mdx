## Flashing

If you are having issues flashing the T-Deck, especially if it's your first attempt, you may need to manually place the device into Espressif's Firmware Download mode. Please follow the process below to do so.

:::warning

Do not proceed unless an antenna is connected to avoid possible damage to the device's radio.

:::

The following process will manually place the device into the Espressif Firmware Download mode:

1. Ensure the device's power switch is toggled OFF.
2. Press and hold the TRACKBALL.
3. Toggle device's power switch ON.
4. After 2-3 seconds, release the TRACKBALL button.
5. If the device screen is black and the backlight is off, the device is in the Firmware Download mode. If the backlight is on, repeat these steps.

With the device now in the Espressif Firmware Download mode, you can proceed with flashing using one of the supported flashing methods. It's generally recommended to use the [Web Flasher](https://flasher.meshtastic.org/). You can select "T Deck" from the device drop-down.
