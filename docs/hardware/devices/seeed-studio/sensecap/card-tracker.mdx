SenseCAP T1000-E is a high-performance tracker designed for Meshtastic. As small as a credit card, effortlessly fitting in your pocket or attaching to your assets. It embeds Semtech's LR1110, Nordic's nRF52840, and Mediatek's AG3335 GPS module, providing Meshtastic users with a high-precision, low-power positioning and communication solution.

:::warning[Note]
Currently, LR1110 radios are unable to receive Meshtastic packets from the older SX127x radios. Semtech is aware of this issue, and we're hopeful they'll provide a solution soon.
