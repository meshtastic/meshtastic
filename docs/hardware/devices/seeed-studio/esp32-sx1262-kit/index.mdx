:::warning[Note]
The Wio-SX1262 module shipped with this kit does not have the same pin configuration as the one shipped with the XIAO nRF52840 kit.
If you want to use a Wio-SX1262 module from a different Seeed kit with a XIAO ESP32S3, you may need to flash custom firmware with the correct pin definitions.
