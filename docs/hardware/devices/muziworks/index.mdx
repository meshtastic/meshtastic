muzi ᴡᴏʀᴋꜱ is dedicated to building tools for adventures outdoors and beyond.

Starting with innovative cases for existing Meshtastic hardware, muzi ᴡᴏʀᴋꜱ first gained recognition with their popular H1 case design. They expanded their lineup with the advanced H2T and R1 cases, offering complete devices built around quality enclosures and hardware from trusted vendors.

muzi ᴡᴏʀᴋꜱ has now introduced their own custom-designed hardware: the R1 Neo complete device and the recently announced Muzi Base development board, demonstrating their continued commitment to advancing Meshtastic products.
