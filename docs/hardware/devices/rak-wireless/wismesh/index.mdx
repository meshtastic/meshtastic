RAK WisMesh is a series of ready-to-use Meshtastic devices designed for seamless deployment. Unlike the WisBlock modular system, which allows users to build and customize their own devices, WisMesh devices provide pre-built, purpose-driven solutions that eliminate the need for assembly or additional configuration.
