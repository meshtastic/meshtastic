## User Button

Any tactile momemtary push button is compatible as long as it is wired to the correct pins, here's a sample of a [Push Button](https://a.co/d/bPhhTxm) 


The button is recommended to be used on the following base board's exposed pins or slots :

- RAK19007 on AIN1 (Pin 31) - See supporting instructions [Here](https://store.rokland.com/pages/adding-a-user-button-rak19007)
- RAK19001 on IO5 (Pin 37)

### Wiring
One side of the switch should be on GND and the other on the recommended Pin per your baseboard. The pin must be configured on the node using the app, webclient or CLI. 

### Resources
For more information on the User Button functionality refer to
