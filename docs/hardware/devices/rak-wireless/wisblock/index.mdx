The RAK WisBlock is a modular hardware system that can be used to build Meshtastic devices.

RAK Wireless currently sells a [Meshtastic Starter kit](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-meshtastic-starter-kit) that has the minimum you need to get started.

If you wish to purchase parts separately, you will need a [WisBlock Base Board](./base-board) and a [WisBlock Core Module](./core-module). Please ensure you choose the correct operating frequency for your country when purchasing.

You can optionally purchase peripherals such as a GPS module, Screen, Sensor, or other various modules.

Please see the RAK documentation for the correct way to connect your hardware to the baseboard to ensure that you do not damage the device.
