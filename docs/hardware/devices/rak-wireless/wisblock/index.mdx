The RAK WisBlock is a modular hardware system that can be used to build Meshtastic devices.

RAKwireless sells multiple **Meshtastic Starter Kits** that have the minimum you need to get started. There are two available options (with each having multiple variants for customizability), one with an [nRF52 core module](https://msh.to/rak4631) and one with an [RP2040 core module](https://msh.to/rak11310).

If you wish to purchase parts separately, you will need a [WisBlock Base Board](./base-board) and a [WisBlock Core Module](./core-module). Please ensure you choose the correct operating frequency for your country when purchasing.

You can optionally purchase peripherals such as a GPS module, Screen, Sensor, or other various modules.

For a full list of RAKwireless Meshtastic-compatible devices and components, visit their [Meshtastic Collection](https://msh.to/rak-collection).

Please see the RAK documentation for the correct way to connect your hardware to the baseboard to ensure that you do not damage the device.
