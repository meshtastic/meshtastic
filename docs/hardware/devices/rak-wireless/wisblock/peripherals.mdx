### Buzzer

#### RAK Buzzer

The [RAK18001 Buzzer Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-buzzer-module-rak18001?utm_source=website_partner&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=meshtastic_rak_collab) may be used with the External Notifications plugin. There is currently a known conflict with the buzzer if the module is placed in Slot D, although other slots should work. NOTE: Many users have complained of the RAK buzzer being very quiet as currently implemented. As of yet, there is no fix for this issue.

### Third Party Buzzer

Another option is to use a standard "passive buzzer" and a transistor (such as a 2N2222 transistor). This can be done by wiring the VCC pin to leg 1 of the transistor and the positive terminal of the buzzer to leg 3. To the central pin (2) of the transistor, connect pin RX1 on the Wisblock board. Connect the negative terminal of the buzzer to the GND pin on the Wisblock board. In settings, go to Device and set Redefine PIN_BUZZER (Buzzer GPIO) to 15. Then go to External Notification and set the module to Enabled, PWM buzzer to enabled, Alert Message Buzzer to enabled and Output Buzzer GPIO to 15. Save your settings and your buzzer should activate whenever you get an incoming message.

### Vibration

To add vibration to your Wisblock device you'll need a standard 3V DC vibramotor and a transistor (such as a 2N2222 transistor). This can be done by wiring the VCC pin to leg 1 of the transistor and the positive (red) wire of the vibramotor to leg 3. To the central pin (2) of the transistor, connect pin AIN1 on the Wisblock board. Connect the negative wire (black) of the vibramotor to the GND pin on the Wisblock board. In settings, go to External Notification and set the module to Enabled, Alert Message Vibra to enabled and Output Vibra GPIO to 31. Save your settings and vibration should activate whenever you get an incoming message.

### IO Module

The [RAK13002 IO Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/adapter-module-rak13002?utm_source=website_partner&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=meshtastic_rak_collab) can be used to, among other things, add a user button to the RAK base boards (excluding the RAK19003 Mini base board). It features a number of different interface options:

- 2x I<sup>2</sup>C interfaces
- 2x UART interfaces
- 1x SPI interface
- Upto 6x GPIOs

### User Button

Any tactile momentary push button is compatible as long as it is wired to the correct pins, here's a sample of a [Push Button](https://a.co/d/bPhhTxm)

The button is recommended to be used on the following base board's exposed pins or slots :

- RAK19007 on AIN1 (Pin 31) - See supporting instructions [Here](https://store.rokland.com/pages/adding-a-user-button-rak19007)
- RAK19001 on IO5 (Pin 37)

#### Wiring

One side of the switch should be on GND and the other on the recommended Pin per your baseboard. The pin must be configured on the node using the app, webclient or CLI.
