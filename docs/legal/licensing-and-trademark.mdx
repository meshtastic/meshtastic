### Community Project Logos: M-Powered & M-PWRD

We are excited to introduce two new logos for our community members: the "M-Powered" and "M-PWRD" logos. These logos are designed to be used by projects that are powered by Meshtastic technology, offering an easy way to indicate compatibility with our platform.

#### Usage Guidelines

- **Variants:**
  - "M-Powered" with the full word "powered."
  - "M-PWRD" with an abbreviated "PWRD" for a cleaner, concise design. This version is particularly recommended for 3D printed objects such as enclosures.
- **Freedom of Use:** Unlike the main Meshtastic logo, using the "M-Powered" or "M-PWRD" logos does not require a trademark grant. These logos are intended for broader use in the community to signify that a project is Meshtastic-compatible.
- **Appropriate Contexts:** In most scenarios, the "M-Powered" or "M-PWRD" logos will be more suitable than the official Meshtastic logo. They are ideal for project documentation, promotional materials, and product designs to show compatibility with Meshtastic.
- **Non-Endorsement:** It's important to note that using these logos does not imply endorsement or sponsorship by the Meshtastic Project. They are purely for indicating compatibility or association with Meshtastic technology.
- **Good Standing Requirement:** Permission to use the M-Powered logo is granted only to individuals or projects that are in good standing within the Meshtastic community. Users who have been banned or are otherwise restricted from community participation due to violations of the [Code of Conduct](https://meshtastic.org/docs/legal/conduct/) are prohibited from using the M-Powered logo in any form.

We have provided design files for these logos in our [Meshtastic Design repository](https://github.com/meshtastic/design/tree/master/Meshtastic%20Powered%20Logo).

## Usage that Require Prior Written Approval

### Social Media

In the past, community members have inquired whether it is permissible to use the Meshtastic Trademarks, including the term "Meshtastic" in a Social Media account. This is permitted provided that the phrasing doesn't indicate official sponsorship by Meshtastic. Examples:

- Meshtastic South Africa Users Group
- Meshtastic North America Community
- Cardiff Meshtastic Club
- Meshtastic UK Association


Examples not permitted:

- Meshtastic
- Meshtastic UK

Meshtastic also grants communities and user groups permission to use the Meshtastic logo, provided it is displayed in a secondary position to the group's primary branding. For example, a hiking club's newsletter might feature their own logo prominently at the top, with the Meshtastic logo placed smaller and below, indicating the technology's support for their activities.

### Domain names

In the past, community members have inquired whether it is permissible to use the Meshtastic Trademarks, including the term "Meshtastic" in an Internet domain name. It is not permissible without written permission of Meshtastic.

### Non-software goods

In the past, community members have inquired whether it is permissible to use Meshtastic Trademarks on non-software goods such as Embedded Systems, Enclosures, Hardware, T-shirts, stickers, and pens.

Community members may request from the Trademark Supervisor designated by the Admins of Meshtastic a license to use the Meshtastic Trademarks on non-software related goods or services, by enquiring at [trademark@meshtastic.org](mailto:trademark@meshtastic.org). The Trademark Supervisor will be responsible for reviewing samples of the goods and services and managing the relationship.

- The adding our logo or other marks to a non-software good may be allowed, with written permission from the the Meshtastic Trademark Supervisior, provided that the non-software good is a 100% original design or the requester has evidence of a grant of use from copyright holder of the original design.
- The adding our logo or other marks to a non-software good is not an endorsement or sponsorship of that good by the Meshtastic Project.

## Unapproved Use

The following uses of the Meshtastic Trademarks are not approved under any foreseeable circumstances.

- Violations of the Logo Usage Guidelines or Trademark Usage Guidelines.
- Any use outside these guidelines not by explicit written permission.
- Except as set forth herein, Meshtastic retains and reserves all rights to the Meshtastic Trademarks and their use, including the right to modify these guidelines.

These guidelines (except for trademark licenses executed for non software goods) may be amended from time to time at the discretion of Meshtastic and such changes will be effective ten (10) days after the changes are posted. Meshtastic may provide you with notice of such changes, but need not do so. You are responsible for checking this site for any changes.

In the past, community members have inquired whether it is permissible to use the Meshtastic Trademarks, including the term "Meshtastic" in software product names. You **may not** use any of Meshtastic Trademarks in either the primary or secondary branding of any third party product or service names. For example, you may not name a product either "BigCo Project Thing", "BigCo distribution of Project", or any similar kind of name where Project is any Meshtastic mark or project name.

## Proper Trademark Use

One of the purposes of Meshtastic is to encourage the use of Meshtastic software to enable the public to come to trust the use of Meshtastic Trademarks. To achieve this purpose it is important that Meshtastic can quickly be identified. Meshtastic has chosen the Meshtastic Logo to identify such software and is granting usage rights in the Meshtastic Logo (and the other Meshtastic Trademarks) as previously described in this document in order to assure widespread availability.
