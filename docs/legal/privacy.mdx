We don't collect any personal identifying information. We never capture usernames or the contents of your texts.

Location data is used to enable features like showing your mesh network on a map. We do not collect or store your location data. If your mesh network has MQTT enabled, location data may be accessed by third parties.

Analytics are collected on the Android and iOS apps, and on the web flasher, to help us know what things we need to improve. We receive anonymized information about user behavior, which includes crash reports, page views, and other usage data. Analytics are provided by [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics)(Android only), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)(web flasher only), and [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/).

The search engine for this website is provided by Algolia, please see their [privacy policy](https://www.algolia.com/policies/privacy) for details of what information they collect.

This is an open-source project run by hobbyists, and we try to be completely transparent. If you have questions on this policy, please [post on the Meshtastic Discussions page](https://github.com/orgs/meshtastic/discussions), and we'll reply/clarify/correct.
