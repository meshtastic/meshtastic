We don't collect any personal identifying information. We never capture usernames or the contents of your texts.

Location data is used to enable features like showing your mesh network on a map. We do not collect or store your location data. If your mesh network has MQTT enabled, location data may be accessed by third parties.

If you opt-in to analytics on the Android app (thank you - that helps us know what things we need to improve), we will receive anonymized information about user behavior. This includes crash reports, screens used in the app, etc... Analytics is provided by [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics).

The search engine for this website is provided by Algolia, please see their [privacy policy](https://www.algolia.com/policies/privacy) for details of what information they collect.

This is an open-source project run by hobbyists, and we try to be completely transparent. If you have questions on this policy, please [post on the Meshtastic Discussions page](https://github.com/orgs/meshtastic/discussions), and we'll reply/clarify/correct.

Keep being awesome!
