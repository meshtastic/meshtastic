| Name | Description |
|:----:|:-----------:|
| Canned Message Plugin | Set a number of predefined messages to send out directly from the device with the use of an input device like a rotary encoder. |
| External Notification Plugin | Incoming messages are able to alert you using circuits you attach to the device (LEDs, Buzzers, etc) |
| Rotary Encoder Plugin | Attach and define input devices such as external keyboards and rotary encoders. |
| Range Test Plugin | Send messages with GPS location at an interval to test the distance your devices can communicate. Requires (at least) one device set up as a sender and one as a receiver. The receiver(s) will log all incoming messages to a CSV. |
| Serial Plugin | Send messages across the mesh by sending strings over a serial port. |
| Store and Forward Plugin | Set a designated node to store messages and resend them to nodes with intermittent connection to a mesh. |
| Telemetry Plugin | Attach sensors to the device and transmit readings on a regular interval to the mesh. |

Once Plugin settings are changed, a **reset** is required for them to take effect.
