## How to Contribute

Contributing translations to the Meshtastic Apple app helps make the project accessible to a wider audience. The Meshtastic Apple app uses [string catalogs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing-and-varying-text-with-a-string-catalog) in Xcode to manage translations. 

If you would like to update the translations for a locale or add a new language, follow these steps.

1. Start by forking the [Meshtastic-Apple repository](<https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-Apple/tree/main>) to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the project and open the `Meshtastic.xcworkspace`
3. Select the `Localizable.xcstrings` file in the project navigator.
4. Follow the steps outlined [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing-and-varying-text-with-a-string-catalog) for adding or updating translations.
5. Create a PR on the project with your changes.

Your contribution will be reviewed, and upon approval, your translation will be included in the next release of the Meshtastic Apple app. Thank you for helping expand the reach of Meshtastic!
