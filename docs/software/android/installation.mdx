## Installation Methods

Our Android application is available on our F-Droid repo and Google Play Store. This allows you to connect to your Meshtastic device from your Android phone via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi (if on the same network) or USB On-The-Go (OTG).

The minimum Android version is 5.0 (Lollipop 2014, first BLE support), however Android 6 (Marshmallow 2015) is recommended as Bluetooth is more stable.
