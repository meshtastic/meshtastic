## Meshtastic Python Library

This library provides a command-line interface (CLI) for managing the user settings of Meshtastic nodes and provides an easy API for sending and receiving messages over mesh radios. Events are delivered using a publish-subscribe model, and you can subscribe to only the message types you are interested in.

The [Meshtastic-python repo](https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-python) is an excellent source of information. If you wish to view the code or contribute to the development of the Python library or the command-line interface, please visit the Meshtastic Python [GitHub page](https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-python).

### Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- **Serial Drivers**: Your computer should have the required serial drivers installed for the [CP210X USB to UART bridge](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) or the [CH9102](http://www.wch.cn/downloads/CH343SER_ZIP.html) (for some newer boards).
- **Python**: Python 3 should be installed on your system. Check with `python3 -V` and install it if necessary.
- **pip**: The Python package installer pip should be installed. Check with `pip3 -V` and install it if necessary.

After ensuring the requirements are met, follow the installation instructions for your operating system in the tabbed section below.

### Installation Instructions

To install the Meshtastic CLI, select the tab for your operating system and follow the step-by-step instructions for installing via `pip`. For Ubuntu only, you can alternatively install the [Standalone version](#standalone-installation-ubuntu-only) if you prefer.

<TabItem value="linux">

#### Linux

- Check that your computer has the required serial drivers installed

  - Connect your Meshtastic device to your USB port
  - Use the command
    ```shell
    lsusb
    ```
  - You should see something like:
    - `ID 10c4:ea60 Silicon Labs CP210x UART Bridge` for CP210X
    - `ID 1a86:55d4 QinHeng Electronics USB Single Serial` for CH9102
      - If there is no seral device shown that matches the device you are using, please review our [Install Serial Drivers](/docs/getting-started/serial-drivers/) page before proceeding.

- Check that your computer has Python 3 installed.

  - Use the command
    ```shell
    python3 -V
    ```
  - If this does not return a version, install python
    ```shell
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3
    ```

- Pip is typically installed if you are using python 3 version >= 3.4

  - Check that pip is installed using this command
    ```shell
    pip3 -V
    ```
  - If this does not return a version, install pip
    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    ```

- Optional: use a python virtual environment (otherwise jump to step "Install pytap2")
  - Install python-virtualenvwrapper (arch based distros as an example)
    ```shell
    sudo pacman -Syu python-virtualenvwrapper
    ```
  - Create a virtual environment
    ```shell
    source /usr/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
    mkvirtualenv meshtastic
    workon meshtastic
    ```
- Install pytap2
  ```shell
  pip3 install --upgrade pytap2
  ```
- Install meshtastic:
  ```shell
  pip3 install --upgrade meshtastic
  ```
  - Using pipx as an alternative to pip3 if `externally-managed-environment` error is encountered
    ```shell
    sudo apt install pipx && pipx install meshtastic
    ```
    - If using `pipx` it may be necessary to update `$PATH` by running:
      ```shell
      pipx ensurepath
      ```

      ```shell
      brew install python3
      ```
- Pip is typically installed if you are using python 3 version >= 3.4

  - Check that pip is installed using this command
    ```shell
    pip3 -V

:::info
When installing Python, make sure to select the option to "Add Python to PATH" or check the box that says "Add Python to environment variables". If you missed this during installation, you can add Python to your system's PATH manually after installation. Failing to do so may result in errors when trying to use Python or pip commands.

  - Check that pip is installed using this command
    ```powershell
    pip3 -V

:::note
Be aware that the Meshtastic CLI is not able to control the nodes over USB through termux, but you can control devices over Wifi using the `--host x.x.x.x` option with the device IP address (ESP32 or Pico W only). Wifi connection is currently under development and may not be working properly just yet. If you would like to provide feedback or test this feature, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ktMAKGBnBs) for more information.
