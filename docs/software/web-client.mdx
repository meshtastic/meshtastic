Meshtastic Web is a Meshtastic client that runs directly in your browser.
There are two ways of accessing the app:

1. A hosted version located at [client.meshtastic.org](https://client.meshtastic.org).
2. Hosting it yourself.

## Compatibility

The application will work in all major browsers, but specific functionality is limited in some cases. For the best experience we recommend using a Chromium based browser such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) or [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge).

### HTTP

This method of connecting is limited to esp32 devices.

:::caution

When using the [hosted](https://client.meshtastic.org) version of the application, all traffic must be served over HTTPS.
Meshtastic nodes generate self-signed certificates, and you must inform your browser that you wish to trust the aforementioned certificate.
This can be done by first accessing your node directly via your browser: `https://NODE_IP_ADDRESS/` replacing `NODE_IP_ADDRESS` with the IP address of your node.
This can be found on the screen of the device, via your router's DHCP lease page or serial console.

:::

You can accessing your device over HTTP after you set up your [Network Connection](/docs/configuration/radio/network)

### Bluetooth

Bluetooth support is governed by the availability of the [Web Bluetooth API](https://web.dev/bluetooth) as illustrated below. Support is primarily available in Chromium based browsers.

### Serial (USB)

The method with the least platform support, which uses the [Web Serial API](https://web.dev/serial), allows us to connect directly to a Meshtastic node over USB and access it from directly within your browser.
