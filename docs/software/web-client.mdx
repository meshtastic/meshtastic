Meshtastic Web is a web-based Meshtastic client that runs directly in your browser.
There are two ways of accessing the client and four ways to connect to devices from the client:

1. An Internet-hosted client located at [client.meshtastic.org](https://client.meshtastic.org) which supports device connections over HTTPS, Bluetooth, and Serial(USB).
2. A self-hosted client which supports device connections over HTTPS, HTTP, Bluetooth, and Serial(USB).

## Compatibility

The Meshtastic Web client works in all major browsers, but specific functionality is limited in some browsers. For the best experience, it is recommended to use a Chromium-based browser such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) or [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge).

### HTTPS

This method of device connection is limited to esp32 devices where the [network connection](/docs/configuration/radio/network) has been configured to connect to the local network and where the HTTPS self-signed certificate has been accepted.

:::caution

Due to security requirements, the [Internet hosted client](https://client.meshtastic.org) requires traffic to be served over HTTPS.
Meshtastic device firmware generates a self-signed certificate, and you must inform your browser that you wish to trust the self-signed certificate for each of your devices.
This can be done by first accessing your device directly via your browser: `https://DEVICE_IP_ADDRESS/` replacing `DEVICE_IP_ADDRESS` with the IP address of your device.
Your device's IP Address can be found on the screen of the device, via your router's DHCP lease page, or the device's serial console.

:::

### HTTP

This method of device connection is limited to self-hosted Mestastic Web client and esp32 devices where the [network connection](/docs/configuration/radio/network) has been configured to connect to the local network.

It is recommended to run the Meshtastic Web client using OCI compatible images with either Docker or Podman from (ghcr.io/meshtastic/web)[https://ghcr.io/meshtastic/web]. (e.g., `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --restart always --name Meshtastic-Web ghcr.io/meshtastic/web`).

### Bluetooth

Bluetooth device connection support is governed by the availability of the [Web Bluetooth API](https://web.dev/bluetooth) as illustrated below. Support is primarily available in Chromium-based browsers.

### Serial(USB)

Serial(USB) device connection support is limited and governed by the availability of the [Web Serial API](https://web.dev/serial) as illustrated below. This connection allows the web client to connect to a local serial port to access the device from your browser.

## Self Hosting

The source code for Meshtastiic Web client can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/meshtastic/web) and the instructions for building and running the project can be found in the (readme)[https://github.com/meshtastic/web/blob/main/packages/web/README.md].

OCI compatible images for Docker and Podman are based on Nginx and are available at (ghcr.io/meshtastic/web)[https://ghcr.io/meshtastic/web] with nightly builds available at (ghcr.io/meshtastic/web:nightly)[http://ghcr.io/meshtastic/web:nightly].
