Meshtastic Web is a Meshtastic client that runs directly in your browser.
There are three ways of accessing the app:

1. Served directly from an ESP32 based node via [meshtastic.local](http://meshtastic.local) or the device's IP Address.[^1]
2. A hosted version located at [client.meshtastic.org](https://client.meshtastic.org).
3. Hosting it yourself.

## Compatibility

The application will work in all major browsers, but specific functionality is limited in some cases. For the best experience we recommend using a Chromium based browser such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) or [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge).

### HTTP

This method of connecting is limited to esp32 devices.

:::caution

When using the [hosted](https://client.meshtastic.org) version of the application, all traffic must be served over HTTPS.
Meshtastic nodes generate self-signed certificates, and you must inform your browser that you wish to trust the aforementioned certificate.
This can be done by first accessing your node directly via your browser: `https://NODE_IP_ADDRESS/` replacing `NODE_IP_ADDRESS` with the IP address of your node.
This can be found on the screen of the device, via your router's DHCP lease page or serial console.

:::

You can accessing your device over HTTP after you set up your [Network Connection](/docs/configuration/radio/network)

### Bluetooth

Bluetooth support is governed by the availability of the [Web Bluetooth API](https://web.dev/bluetooth) as illustrated below. Support is primarily available in Chromium based browsers.

### Serial (USB)

The method with the least platform support, which uses the [Web Serial API](https://web.dev/serial), allows us to connect directly to a Meshtastic node over USB and access it from directly within your browser.

## Updating

When a new firmware version is released, the latest available version of the Web UI (littlefswebui.bin) is included in the release folder for each supported ESP32 device. To update the Web UI, use the [Meshtastic Web Flasher](https://flasher.meshtastic.org/). First, toggle "Full Erase and Install" to reveal the "Bundle Web UI" option, then enable "Bundle Web UI" before flashing.

Additionally, the Web UI can be updated via the [install scripts](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/esp32/cli-script.mdx) using the `--web` option.

## Self Hosting

The source code for the WebUI can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/meshtastic/web)

Instructions for building and running the project can be found in the repo's readme.

[^1]: If multiple Meshtastic devices are serving the web client on the same local area network, these devices can be reached by adding a suffix of "-2" (or higher numbers if there are additional devices) to the local URL. Example `meshtastic-2.local` or `meshtastic-3.local`.
