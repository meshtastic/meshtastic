description: Instructions for building InkHUD with a different character set
---

Because of hardware constraints, fonts contain a limited number of characters. 
By default, InkHUD is built with a "Western European" character set (Windows-1252).
Fonts are also provided for "Central European" and "Cyrillic" character sets.

## Choosing a Character Set

Wikipedia maintains a comprehensive list of which languages are supported by each character set.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252 - Western European (InkHUD default) 
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1250 - Central European
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1251 - Cyrillic


## Changing the Character Set

To use an alternative character set, you will need to [build the Meshtastic firmware](/docs/development/firmware/build/).

The choice of font is set in `/variants/<Device Model>/nicheGraphics.h`. 

Find the lines:
```cpp
// Prepare fonts
InkHUD::Applet::fontLarge = FREESANS_9PT_WIN1252;
InkHUD::Applet::fontSmall = FREESANS_6PT_WIN1252;
```
Replace with either:
```cpp
InkHUD::Applet::fontLarge = FREESANS_9PT_WIN1250;
InkHUD::Applet::fontSmall = FREESANS_6PT_WIN1250;
```
```cpp
InkHUD::Applet::fontLarge = FREESANS_9PT_WIN1251;
InkHUD::Applet::fontSmall = FREESANS_6PT_WIN1251;
```
