## DIY Presets

Tried-and-tested hardware combinations, with pre-made configurations.

### Supported Hardware

#### Base Device
* Heltec Mesh Node T114
* NRF52 Pro-micro DIY

#### Display Module
* WeAct Studio 1.54" B&W
* WeAct Studio 2.13" B&W (2025 Revision)
* WeAct Studio 2.9" B&W
* WeAct Studio 4.2" B&W

### Firmware

Although configurations for these devices are provided, you will still need to build the Meshtastic firmware.

#### Building With Visual Studio Code

First, [set up the build environment](/docs/development/firmware/build/#build), then:

1. Open the PlatformIO Project Tasks pane

2. Select the environment which matches your node hardware
    * `heltec-mesh-node-t114-inkhud`
    * `nrf52_promicro_diy-inkhud`

3. Run the Build task which matches your display model
![custom platformio build tasks for diy presets](/img/software/inkhud/diy-presets.webp)

4. Once build is complete, find the generated .uf2 file at `./pio/build/<environment>/firmware.uf2`

#### Building with Platformio CLI

Execute `pio run -e <environment> -t <build task>`, where:

`<environment>`
* `heltec-mesh-node-t114-inkhud`
* `nrf52_promicro_diy-inkhud`

`<build task>`
* `build_weact_154`
* `build_weact_213`
* `build_weact_290`
* `build_weact_420`

Then find the generated .uf2 file at `./pio/build/<environment>/firmware.uf2`

### Installation

Install the generated .uf2 file to device using the [drag and drop method](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/drag-n-drop/#nrf52).

## Other Hardware

Using InkHUD on hardware beyond the standard DIY presets will require manual customization of the firmware. 
No specific support can be given here; only a general overview.

**Check for a Display Driver**

InkHUD relies on custom display drivers. 
These are located in `/src/graphics/niche/Drivers/EInk/`.
Choose a display which is already supported, otherwise you will have to write the driver yourself, which requires some specialist knowledge.

**Clone and Modify an Existing InkHUD Variant**

The general instructions for [building with custom hardware](/docs/development/firmware/build/#build-with-custom-hardware) apply here.
In addition to modifying the `variant.h` file, you should also [modify `nicheGraphics.h`](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/tree/master/src/graphics/niche/InkHUD/docs#nichegraphicsh), 
which is responsible for InkHUD's per-variant configuration.
