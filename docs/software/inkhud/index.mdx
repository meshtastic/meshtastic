## What is InkHUD?

InkHUD is a user interface for Meshtastic devices which have an E-Ink display. It is designed to give a quick "heads-up", showing important information at a glance, complimenting a connected [client app](/downloads/). Specifically targeting E-Ink displays, it is offered as an alternative to the original OLED user interface.

Under active development since late 2024, the list of features and supported devices will continue to grow.

## Supported Devices
As of March 2025. Watch this space ðŸ‘€

- **Complete Devices**
  - LilyGo T-Echo
  - Heltec Wireless Paper
  - Heltec Vision Master E213
  - Heltec Vision Master E290
- **DIY Displays** (custom builds, _for the brave.._)
  - WeAct Studio 4.2" Black & White

## Installation

InkHUD can be installed on supported devices using the [Meshtastic Web Flasher](https://flasher.meshtastic.org). Select a 2.6+ version firmware, and toggle the `Install InkHUD display` option on the flash screen.

Prebuilt firmware binaries are also available on the [downloads page](/downloads/). The InkHUD versions are identified by the **"-inkhud"** suffix in the filename.

If you wish to use InkHUD with a DIY Meshtastic device, you will need to [build the firmware manually](/docs/development/firmware/build/), specially configuring InkHUD for your hardware.
{/* Todo: link to InkHUD's maintainer doc (readme in firmware repo), once merged. */}

## Initial Setup

* [Set your LoRa region](/docs/configuration/region-by-country/)
* [Set your timezone](/docs/configuration/radio/device#tzdef-timezone-definition)

## Buttons

InkHUD is designed to be used with just one button. A mixture of short and long button presses are use to control the user interface.

## Applets

InkHUD provides a set of applets, each one showing a different set of information. You can choose which applets to enable using the on-screen menu. For in-depth descriptions, see the [List of InkHUD Applets](./applets.mdx).

* **Short-press**: switch to the next applet.

## On-Screen Menu

InkHUD has a built in menu, with a few basic actions, and options for configuring the device.

To open the on-screen menu, **long-press** the user button.
* **short-press**: next item
* **long-press**: select

Only wanted a quick peek at the clock? Long-press a second time to close the menu.

### Options

#### Applet Selection

Choose which applets to enable. Allows you to customize the information shown by the display.

#### Auto-show

Choose which applets will be automatically shown, when they have new information to display.

Example: enabling auto-show for the All Messages applet will cause InkHUD to swap to All Messages when a new text message arrives.

#### Recents Duration

Some applets show information which is a summary of the last few minutes. This option allows you to configure how many minutes of information those applets should show.

#### Layout

InkHUD can "tile" multiple applets at once, dividing the display area between them. This option changes how many applets are shown.

#### Rotation

Rotate the display clockwise, 90Â° at a time.

#### Notifications

If enabled, show pop-up notifications for new messages at top of display. This is an alternative to the the auto-show feature, which would instead switch applets to display the new message.

#### Battery Icon

If enabled, show a small icon which indicates battery's state of charge, in the top-right corner of the display.

## Multiple Applets

InkHUD can show multiple applets at the same time; a feature knows as _tiling_. To change the amount of tiles, select `Options > Layout` in the on-screen menu.

### Moving between tiles

#### Using the Menu

For most devices, the on-screen menu is used to move between tiles.

#### Using an Extra Button

Some devices have an extra hardware button, which provides a more convenient method of moving between tiles.
