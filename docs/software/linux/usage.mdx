## meshtasticd CLI options

Additional arguments can be given to the program, which are listed as follows:

- `-c CONFIG_FILE`: The configuration file to use.
- `-d DIRECTORY`: The directory to use as the virtual filesystem (VFS).
- `-e`: Erase the virtual filesystem before use.
- `-h MAC_ADDRESS`: The MAC address to assign to this virtual machine.
- `-p TCP_PORT`: The local TCP port to use for running the Meshtastic API.

## Usage with Docker

If you do not own a Linux machine, or you just want to separate things, you might want
to run the application inside a docker container.

### Usage

First, [Pull the image](/docs/software/linux/installation/?os=docker)

To run a container, type

```shell
docker run -p 4403:4403 --restart unless-stopped --name meshtasticd meshtastic/meshtasticd:beta-debian
```

or, to get an interactive shell on the docker created container:

```shell
docker run -it -p 4403:4403 --restart unless-stopped --name meshtasticd meshtastic/meshtasticd:beta-debian bash
```

or with Docker compose:

```plaintext
services:
  meshtasticd:
    image: meshtastic/meshtasticd:beta-debian # can also use alpine base image (beta-alpine)
    container_name: meshtasticd
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "4403:4403" # API port
      - "443:443" # optional, for WebUI - ensure port is set to 443 in config file and you are using a debian base image
    volumes:
      - ./config.yaml:/etc/meshtasticd/config.yaml:ro # config file
      - ./prefs:/var/lib/meshtasticd/prefs/ # optional - persists some prefs over a container reboot
```

### CH341 USB

If you want to use a `CH341` USB adapter (MeshStick), you need to pass the `bus` device to the container with the `--device` flag:

First, locate the USB device with `lsusb`:

```shell
lsusb
```

You should see something like this:

```plaintext
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 1199:9091 Sierra Wireless, Inc. EM7565-9
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 8087:0032 Intel Corp. AX210 Bluetooth
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 13d3:56b2 IMC Networks Integrated Camera
Bus 001 Device 005: ID 06cb:009a Synaptics, Inc. Metallica MIS Touch Fingerprint Reader
Bus 001 Device 006: ID 1a86:5512 QinHeng Electronics CH341 in EPP/MEM/I2C mode, EPP/I2C adapter
```

Locate the `CH341` device and take note of the **Bus** and **Device** numbers. In this example: `001/006`.

Then, run the container with the `--device` flag,
additionally mounting a local configuration file:

```shell
docker run -it -p 4403:4403 --restart unless-stopped --name meshtasticd --device=/dev/bus/usb/001/006 -v ./config.yaml:/etc/meshtasticd/config.yaml:ro meshtastic/meshtasticd:beta
```

### SPI radio pass-through
If you would like to use SPI to communicate with your radio (mainly for Raspberry Pi users), you need to pass the `/dev/spidev*` device into the container.

To find the device, you can ls `/dev/spidev`. there will be a device like `/dev/spidev0.0` (example)

Then, pass this device into the container:

Compose:
```plaintext
    devices:
      - "/dev/spidev<your_spi_id>:/dev/spidev<your_spi_id>"
```

Docker run:
```plaintext
--device=/dev/spidev<your_spi_id>:/dev/spidev<your_spi_id>
```

If you have issues, add the privileged flag:

Compose:
```plaintext
    devices:
      - "/dev/spidev<your_spi_id>:/dev/spidev<your_spi_id>"
    privileged: true
```

Docker run:
```plaintext
--device=/dev/spidev<your_spi_id>:/dev/spidev<your_spi_id> --privileged
```



### Executing the application interactively

To use Python CLI against exposed TCP port 4403,
type this in the host machine:

```shell
meshtastic --info --host localhost
```

You can interact with the container in the same way as a normal device using a client that supports TCP connections.

### Stop the container

If started with the `--name meshtasticd` arg, you can stop the container with the following command:

```shell
docker kill meshtasticd
```

Else, run this to get the ID:

```shell
docker ps
```

Then, stop the container with command:

```shell
docker kill <id>
```

> Tip: you can just use the first few characters of the ID in docker commands
