Meshtastic nodes built with RAKwireless hardware are already easy to get started with, thanks to available starter kits. But what if you need a more specialized setup for your project? Like a network of sensors for environmental monitoring, or an enclosure for outdoor deployment?

That’s where Meshtastic Designer comes in. This new web-based tool from RAKwireless makes it easy to configure and visualize your WisBlock-based Meshtastic setup before you buy, ensuring you get the right hardware for your specific use case. Whether you’re optimizing for long-range communication, off-grid power, or specialized sensor deployments, Meshtastic Designer helps you configure the right setup with confidence.

## Built for the Meshtastic Community

RAKwireless recognizes that Meshtastic is a powerful tool for data transmission, enabling applications like remote sensor management, environmental monitoring, and innovative off-grid communication networks. For them, the Meshtastic community was the natural starting point for this new tool.

Seeing the projects built by the community, they understood how the flexibility of WisBlock modules has expanded what’s possible within the Meshtastic ecosystem, inspiring countless creative applications. A common example is the deployment of solar-powered nodes for remote, off-grid communication. However, they also recognized the challenges users faced when designing these projects—the trial and error of selecting the right hardware, ensuring compatibility, and optimizing for specific needs.

Meshtastic Designer was created to solve these challenges, making it easier for users to confidently configure WisBlock-based Meshtastic setups without the guesswork. Instead of manually checking compatibility or testing different configurations after you purchase your hardware, you can quickly build and refine your setup before ordering.

## How It Works

Meshtastic Designer walks you through selecting WisBlock modules compatible with Meshtastic, ensuring everything works together. The tool provides a 3D visualization of your setup and gives suggestions for relevant components and highlights any incompatibilities (e.g., sensors not compatible with selected slots).

Once you're happy with your design, you can:

- Share your configuration with others using a link or QR code
- Export your setup details to help assist enclosure design, layout planning, or other customizations
- Purchase the exact WisBlock modules you've selected directly through the tool
