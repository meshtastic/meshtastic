As the Meshtastic project continues to grow, so does the number of supported hardware devices. While this growth is exciting and shows just how far the project has come, it also brings new challenges.

Supporting a wide range of hardware requires a significant amount of resources. This includes developer time for maintenance and bug fixes, GitHub runners to build firmware, server space to store hundreds of binaries, and space in the flasher and documentation. All of these factors contribute to increased complexity, making it harder for users to find the hardware they are looking for.

With new devices actively being developed for Meshtastic by several manufacturers, managing this ecosystem efficiently has become a top priority.

## A Collaborative Path Forward

We’ve been working closely with hardware manufacturers to determine a sustainable strategy for hardware support. These conversations focused on identifying which devices each manufacturer intends to actively support moving forward. This has been a collaborative process, and we appreciate their participation and feedback.

From these discussions, we’ve created a new system that classifies devices into two categories:

- **Officially Supported**
- **Community Supported**

## Officially Supported Devices

Devices in this category are those that manufacturers have chosen to support through participation in the Meshtastic Backer and Partner programs. These devices receive official support from the core Meshtastic team and are included in all key tooling: the Web Flasher, documentation, client apps, and other areas.

This list is not static. As manufacturers release new hardware or choose to end support for specific models, the list of officially supported devices may change.

## Community Supported Devices

Devices that are no longer actively supported by the manufacturer or do not have backing through our support programs will move to the **Community Supported** category.

Here’s what that means:

- Firmware for these devices will continue to be built and made available through GitHub releases.
- The core Meshtastic team will no longer provide direct support for these devices.
- Support will be provided by the community.
- Some devices will be removed from the Web Flasher, though this will happen gradually to give the community time to adjust.
- Devices will be moved to a new Community Supported section in the documentation.
- In the client apps, devices will be labeled as either officially or community supported. Community Supported devices will no longer display device images.

## Why This Matters

We understand this is a significant change, but it is a necessary one. Meshtastic currently supports over 100 devices. While this level of choice is valuable, it has made long-term sustainability difficult. Several hardware partners have already committed to releasing new devices this year, which will only increases the challenge if we do not take steps now to streamline support.

The number of devices impacted by this first transition is relatively small and consists primarily of older or legacy models. However, this list will evolve as we continue collaborating with manufacturers on their upcoming devices. We will do our best to make these transitions clear and manageable for everyone involved.

## Thank You

We appreciate the continued support from our community and hardware partners. This update is part of our ongoing effort to ensure the long-term health and scalability of the Meshtastic project.
