The Meshtastic Team is excited to announce Meshtastic Solutions. This new venture will support the Meshtastic open source project, as well as provide a pool of expertise for anyone building tools and systems with Meshtastic. Meshtastic Solutions will ensure the long-term health and success of the Meshtastic team and ecosystem, as well as to spur development of the Meshtastic firmware, clients, libraries, and utilities.

This support will be fueled by partnerships with hardware vendors, many that you are familiar with, and some that are new to Meshtastic. In time, high quality devices will bear the Meshtastic seal of approval. Individual devices will be eligible for registration through Meshtastic, providing assurance of genuine hardware, as well as identity and cryptographic key attestation.

Meshtastic Solutions will also serve as a hub for businesses that need custom solutions or expert consultation within the Meshtastic ecosystem. Meshtastic Solutions is open for business for providing engineering, software solutions, and other support for custom use-cases. The first stage of this support is the Backer program, where existing manufacturers can financially support Meshtastic. This will be extended to include a full Partner program, offering in-depth design, close support, and device testing assistance. All with the goal of helping hardware vendors produce the best products possible for Meshtastic.

Meshtastic Solutions is separate from both the Meshtastic open source project, and Meshtastic LLC, the license and trademark holding entity. There will be no drastic changes to the Meshtastic project as a result of this new venture, with the exception of more development and higher quality products and solutions to choose from. This support from Backers and Partners will fuel some long-awaited milestones, including a well-tested Stable firmware release.

Weâ€™re looking forward to a stronger Meshtastic ecosystem that continues in the strong open source legacy the project has worked hard to foster. Follow our progress at [Meshtastic.com](https://meshtastic.com), and feel free to contact us with questions or to discuss business opportunities.
