The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is currently considering a proposal from NextNav that could drastically reshape the 900 MHz band. While this proposal may seem like just another routine reconfiguration, it has significant implications for a broad range of users, particularly those who rely on unlicensed spectrum for innovative, community-driven projects. At the heart of the debate lies the potential impact on open-source initiatives like Meshtastic, an open-source, decentralized communication platform that operates in the 900 MHz ISM band.

As a community, we are raising our voices in opposition to this proposal, and here’s why we believe it’s crucial for all stakeholders, especially amateur radio operators, tech enthusiasts, and public safety advocates, to understand the ramifications of this change.

## Understanding the 900 MHz Band and Its Importance

The 900 MHz band is a critical piece of spectrum used for various applications, including industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) purposes, as well as amateur radio. It’s a unique band that supports a wide array of technologies, from garage door openers and baby monitors to more advanced uses like Meshtastic’s decentralized communication networks.

Meshtastic leverages LoRa (Long Range) technology to facilitate long-distance communication without relying on centralized infrastructure. This capability is especially valuable in remote areas where traditional communication networks are either unavailable or unreliable. The proposal by NextNav threatens to disrupt this delicate balance by reallocating portions of the 900 MHz band, which could severely impact these unlicensed applications.

## Key Concerns with NextNav’s Proposal

### 1. Potential Interference with Unlicensed Bands

NextNav’s proposal suggests creating a 5-MHz uplink in the 902-907 MHz band paired with a 10-MHz downlink in the 918-928 MHz band. However, these changes could lead to significant interference with existing unlicensed, low-power devices that currently operate within these frequencies. For the Meshtastic community and others relying on these bands, the result could be a substantial degradation in network performance, especially in rural and underserved regions where alternatives are limited.

### 2. Impact on Innovation and Open-Source Projects

Open-source projects like Meshtastic thrive in an environment where access to unlicensed spectrum is available for experimentation and innovation. By granting exclusive or prioritized access to these frequencies, the FCC risks stifling the creativity and diversity of applications that have historically driven advancements in wireless technology.

The open-source community has long been a bastion of innovation, creating technologies that benefit a wide range of users, from hobbyists to public safety officials. Restricting access to this spectrum could not only limit the development of new tools and applications but also hinder the progression of existing projects that rely on these frequencies.

### 3. Threat to Public Safety and Community Resilience

In disaster-prone or remote areas, decentralized communication networks are often the only lifeline when traditional infrastructure fails. Meshtastic’s low-power, long-range communication capabilities have proven invaluable in such situations, providing critical connectivity in times of need. By reallocating the spectrum these networks depend on, NextNav’s proposal could inadvertently weaken community resilience and public safety.

### 4. Equity and Accessibility Concerns

One of the most powerful aspects of the unlicensed spectrum is its ability to democratize communication. It allows small-scale operators, hobbyists, and underserved communities to build and maintain their own networks without the need for expensive licenses or subscriptions. NextNav’s proposal risks creating a barrier to entry, effectively widening the digital divide and excluding those who can’t afford to compete with larger entities for spectrum access.

## Meshtastic's Formal Opposition to NextNav’s 900 MHz Proposal

As part of our commitment to protecting the interests of our community and the broader public that relies on the 900 MHz band, Meshtastic has officially filed an opposition to NextNav’s proposed changes with the FCC. This filing outlines our concerns about the potential interference and the negative impact this reallocation could have on open-source projects, innovation, and public safety.

We believe it's vital that the FCC hears from all stakeholders who will be affected by these changes. By formally opposing the proposal, we aim to ensure that the voices of small-scale operators, hobbyists, and underserved communities are heard.

## Key Takeaways

- **Unlicensed Spectrum is Vital:** The 900 MHz band is crucial for a wide range of applications, particularly for community-driven projects like Meshtastic that rely on this spectrum to operate effectively.
- **Innovation at Risk:** Limiting access to unlicensed spectrum could stifle innovation within the open-source community, hindering the development of new technologies and applications.
- **Public Safety Concerns:** Decentralized communication networks provide critical connectivity in emergencies; reallocating this spectrum could weaken these vital lifelines.
- **Equity and Accessibility:** The unlicensed spectrum serves as a democratizing resource, and restricting access could disproportionately impact small-scale operators and underserved communities.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: What exactly is NextNav proposing with the 900 MHz band?**  
A1: NextNav is proposing to reconfigure the lower 900 MHz band by creating a 5-MHz uplink in the 902-907 MHz band paired with a 10-MHz downlink in the 918-928 MHz band, which could interfere with existing unlicensed uses of this spectrum.

**Q2: How will this proposal impact Meshtastic users?**  
A2: The proposal could cause significant interference with Meshtastic’s low-power, long-range communication networks, potentially degrading performance, especially in remote and underserved areas.

**Q3: Why is unlicensed spectrum important for open-source projects?**  
A3: Unlicensed spectrum allows for experimentation and innovation without the need for costly licenses, fostering a diverse range of applications and advancing wireless technology.

**Q4: What are the potential public safety implications of this proposal?**  
A4: By reallocating spectrum that decentralized networks rely on, the proposal could undermine public safety by weakening the communication networks used in emergencies.

**Q5: Who stands to lose the most if this proposal is approved?**  
A5: Small-scale operators, hobbyists, and underserved communities who rely on unlicensed spectrum for affordable communication solutions are likely to be the most affected.

## Conclusion

The proposed changes to the 900 MHz band by NextNav could have far-reaching consequences for a wide range of users, particularly those involved in community-driven, open-source projects like Meshtastic.
